  "transcript": "Koans often ask us to stand in the middle of contradiction. Movement and stillness seem like opposites, yet in practice they interpenetrate.\\n\\nConsider walking meditation. The foot is in motion, but the mind can be still. The stillness is not frozen; it is receptive, open, and curious. When we rush to name the world, we feel pushed by it. When we pause inside movement, the same world feels spacious.\\n\\nIn traffic or in an argument, we can let one breath widen the frame. Ask: who is moving here? The body, the thoughts, the roles we play? Beneath them is awareness itself—unchanged whether the flag flaps or hangs.\\n\\nThis talk invites you to taste that awareness during the busiest parts of your day. If you can find it there, you will know it was never absent."
