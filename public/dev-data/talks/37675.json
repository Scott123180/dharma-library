  "transcript": "It's from The Gateless Gate, case 45, the main case.\nMaster Wutsu Fayan said,\nShakyamuni and Maitreya are but the servants of another.\nNow tell me, who is that other?\nThe commentary.\nIf you can see this one and are absolutely clear about them,\nit will be like coming upon your own parent at the crossroad.\nYou don't have to ask someone else whether you're correct or incorrect\nin recognizing them as your parent.\nWoman's Poem.\nDo not draw another person's bow.\nDo not ride another person's horse.\nDo not defend another person's fault.\nDo not inquire into another person's affairs.\nGood morning.\nI was thinking this morning of we the people\nin order to form a more perfect union.\nAnd I was thinking about how those words, as we know,\nat that time,\nwe the people excluded so, so, so many people\nconsciously, deliberately, decisively.\nAnd yet, in uttering those words,\nit set a wheel into motion,\na mandate, if you will.\nAn imperative.\nIn order to form a more perfect union.\nAnd that how language can be like that.\nWe can speak something that is true,\nbut it's not yet true for us,\nin our own experience.\nI think of David White saying,\nparaphrasing,\ndo we understand,\ndo I understand the implications of love?\nWhen I say I love you\nfor the first time to someone,\ndo I understand the implications of that?\nWhen I took the Buddhist precepts\nand my teacher said,\nwill you maintain these well?\nAnd I said yes, three times.\nI didn't fully understand what I was doing.\nOr saying yes to.\nYes, I couldn't.\nBut I was setting into motion\na wheel that,\nif I have integrity,\nif I meant those words,\nif I continue to live by those words,\ndemanded that I come to a better\nand better understanding\nof what I said,\nwhat I committed to.\nThat's why in Buddhist practice,\nand tradition,\nto take vows\nis considered a very important thing.\nThogun said it's like\nan inner alignment,\nan inner conversion,\nbecause if we take a vow\nand then don't live by it,\nthat's much more consequential karma\nof the negative kind\nthan if I don't take that vow\nand do the same thing.\nIn the midst of\npain and confusion,\nhow do we find peace in the world?\nWhat is the meaning of this life?\nWhat is its purpose?\nAre those the same?\nAre those different things?\nThe Buddha said we have to,\nif we really want to,\nnot only come to understanding,\nbut actually discover that\nwithin ourselves,\nwe have to meet the one\nwho creates heaven and hell\nup close.\nWe don't have to travel\nvery far for that.\nIn fact,\nyou don't have to take a step.\nThe Buddha discovered\nthat to know the real ground,\nthe basis,\nI'd say the principle\nin which everything arises,\nwe have to look within\nour own mind.\nAnd every practitioner\nhears that,\nI heard that,\nand I thought,\nokay,\nI'll do that,\nI can do that.\nI didn't know what that meant.\nI thought I did.\nI understand the words.\nIn a sense,\nit wasn't time for me\nto know that yet.\nI needed to begin practicing\nand then begin to discover\nto what degree and depth\nI did not know\nwhat that meant.\nAnd not only to know\nour own mind,\nbut the mind of all\nsentient beings\nand the mind of all phenomena.\nWe each have a name,\na body,\nwe have breath,\nwe have a voice,\nwe have beliefs,\nmemories,\nconcerns for the future.\nWe have received\nuncountable messages,\na number of messages\nconveying who we are,\nwho I am specifically,\nwho you are specifically,\nwhat you are,\nwhat's important in this life,\nwhat is not,\nwhat is success,\nwhat is failure,\nwhat is happiness,\nwhat is sadness.\nAnd in a way,\nthose are the things\nthat we make\nour possessions.\nThat's what we sort of\npopulate our house with.\nAnd that's what we call\nthe self,\nmy life,\nthe world.\nMaster Lin-Jee said,\nthere is a true person\nof no rank\nmoving in and out\nof the senses.\nA true person\nof no rank.\nThere is a true person,\nwhich implies\nthere is a person\nthat is not true.\nHow can it be\nthat we can have\nevery need fulfilled\nand more?\nHave health,\nhave family,\nhave work,\nbe educated\nand still feel\nimpoverished?\nIs it because\nthere is something\nwrong with us?\nOr is it because\nthere is something\nthat those\ncan't\nfulfill?\nAnd what is it\nabout us\nas human beings\nthat has this\ndeep desire\nto know,\nto make contact,\nto come closer,\nto unify,\nto have union?\nAnd what does\nthat mean,\nto have union?\nUnion with what?\nIt seems to be\nsort of an inherent\npart of our\nconsciousness.\nwhich means\nto have\nsome sense\nthat we are\nnot in union.\nAnd if we can\nallow ourselves\nto actually\nmake contact\nwith the\nactual,\nwe might even\nsay healthy,\npain of that.\nHealthy because\nit's a yearning\nthat is yearning\nfor something\nwe actually\nneed.\nBut then the\nkey is,\ncan we\nrespond or\npursue that\nyearning\nwell?\nAnd that's\na big if.\nThat's what the\nBuddha's life\nwas devoted to,\noffering a path\nto just that.\nSo in our\naccomplishments,\nour relationships,\nour possessions,\nthe Buddha said,\nall of those\nare part of\nour lives.\nThey do bring\nenjoyment,\nhappiness,\nfulfillment,\nand they all\nleave us.\nEvery one of\nthem.\nEverything that\nwe have,\nwe will lose.\nThat's what the\nBuddha said.\nHe wasn't\nmaking that up.\nIt wasn't a\ntheory.\nIt wasn't\nsomething we\ncan vote on.\nIt's just the\nway it is.\nWhat we do\nabout that,\nthat's a whole\nother thing.\nSo when all\nof those things\nfall away,\nor any one\nof them at\nany point,\nthen the\nquestion often\narises is,\nwho am I\nnow?\nWho am I\nwithout this?\nNot that.\nI'm no\nlonger this\nperson in\nthis role,\nin this\nposition,\nwith this\nperson in\nmy life,\nwith these\npossessions,\nat this\ntime in\nmy life,\nwith this\nbody or\nmind.\nWho am I\nnow?\nWe don't\nhave to wait\nto find\nto find\nout.\nSo\nMaster\nWoodsefayan,\nwho was a\n12th century\nChinese master,\nsaid,\nShakyamuni and\nMaitreya Buddha\nare servants\nto someone.\nRight now,\nspeak up.\nWho is that\nsomeone?\nNow, of\ncourse, the\nBuddha is the\nBuddha, Shakyamuni,\nour original\nteacher.\nWe would\nnot be here\nunless the\nBuddha Shakyamuni\nor someone\nbecame the\nBuddha and\ndevoted their\nlife to\nteaching,\noffering us\nthese teachings\nin this path.\nAnd so for\npractitioners,\nfor sincere\nBuddhists,\nthe Buddha,\nwe hold in\nour mind with\ngreat respect,\ndevotion,\nreverence.\nThis is\nnatural.\nBuddhism,\nlike all\nthings,\nis impermanent.\nBuddhism,\nthe vehicle,\nBuddhism,\nthe tradition.\nAnd so it\nteaches that\nit itself\nwill eventually\nfall away,\nperish,\nthat there\nwill be a\nperiod of\ntime in\nwhich there\nis no\nBuddhism,\nthere is\nno Dharma,\nthere are\nno teachings,\nnobody knows\nanything about\nit.\nAnd then\nsomeone will\nappear and\nbecome enlightened.\nand teach.\nThat's\nMaitreya,\nthe Buddha of\nthe future.\nAnd that that\nhas been\nhappening for\na long,\nlong time.\nThe Buddha\nwas just\nthe Buddha\nof our\ntime.\nSo here,\nBayan is\nsaying Shakyamuni\nand Maitreya\nare servants\nto someone\nelse.\nWho is\nthat someone\nelse?\nSo, you\nknow,\nin our\nculture,\nwe can\nsort of\nglorify the\none who\ndoesn't have\nreverence,\nwho doesn't\nbow down,\nwho doesn't\nowe anything\nto anybody.\nI got here\non my own.\nRight?\nA great\nlie.\nBut consider\nhow startling\nthis koan\nwould be,\nis supposed\nto be,\nactually,\nto someone\nsteeped in\nhonoring one's\nparents,\none's family,\none's teachers,\none's country,\nthis sense\nof great\nresponsibility\nto have\nreverence\ngratitude,\nand gratitude,\nto be\naware of\nall that\none has\nreceived.\nSo,\nthink about\nhow startling\nthis koan\nwould be.\nWhat is\nBayan\nsaying?\nShakyamuni\nand Maitreya,\nthese great\nfigures,\nthese enlightened\nbeings that we\nowe so much\nto,\nare someone's\nservants.\nWho is\nthat someone?\nWho is\nthat one?\nWho is\nthat one?\nWho is\nthat person\nof no rank?\nIf I say\nit's me,\nwell,\nthat's just\nmore me.\nI'm just\nadding that\nto my\ncollection of\npossessions.\nIf I say\nit's not me,\nthen I'm\ndenying\nmy fundamental\nnature\nand my\nresponsibility.\nWhy\nresponsibility?\nFrom the\nplace where\neverything\nexists apart\nand distinct\nand separate,\nI have\nmine,\nyou have\nyours,\nI protect\nmine,\nyou protect\nyours,\nthose are\nthe rules,\nthen it\nmakes sense\nthat my\nresponsibility\nis to\nme and\nmine,\nyours is\nto yours\nand you\nand yours.\nBut when\nwe see\nthat we\nare in\nwhat is\ndescribed as\nan intricate\nweb of\ncausation,\na mutual\nhorizon,\nof codependency,\nthat no one\narrives on\ntheir own,\nnothing appears\nin any\nmoment by\nitself.\nThere is\nno itself\nalone.\nThat was the\nBuddha's\nenlightenment.\nAnd his\nenlightenment,\nlet's\nremember,\nwas his\nliberation.\nAnd what\nhe was\nenlightened\nto was\nhis\nliberation.\nWhen we\nrealize that,\neven when we\nbegin to have\nfaith in it,\nwhen we\nbegin to\npractice on\nthe basis\nof that,\nwe begin to\nsee that we\ncannot,\nwe have,\nwe are\nresponsible,\nand we\ncannot\nabdicate it.\nThat also\nis not up for a\nvote.\nalthough we\nvote on it\nall the time.\nIt's not up\nfor a vote\nbecause it\ncannot be\nabdicated.\nIt comes\nwith human\nlife.\nBecause\nwe rise\ntogether.\nBecause we\nare codependent.\nIt's like\na tree\ndeclaring,\nI'm on my\nown here.\nI don't\nneed all\nof you.\nI don't\nneed soil,\nI don't\nneed grass,\nI don't\nneed insects,\nI don't\nneed birds,\nI don't\nneed sky,\nI don't\nneed sunlight,\nI don't\nneed rain.\nWhat's\ngoing on in\nthe woods\nover there,\nthat's not\nmy business.\nit helps\nus to see\nwhat is\ntrue\ncompassion,\nwhat is\nselfless\ncompassion.\nThere were\nsome questions\nthat came\nup in the\nweekend,\nwhich,\nyou know,\nnon-attachment\ncan be\ndeeply\nmisunderstood\nas leading\nto a\nkind of\napathy,\nindifference,\nlack of\nconcern,\na lack\nof\ncaring,\nkind of\npassivity.\nIt's the\nexact opposite.\nThat it's our\nattachments that\nactually bind and\nhinder and\nlimit and\nobstruct our\nnatural\ninclination to\ncare and to\nserve and\nto\nhelp.\nAnd in a\nway, we have\nto be alert\nto that.\nWe have to be\naware of our\npractice and\nthat we're not\nactually cultivating\nas we let go\nof getting\nentangled in\nour emotions,\nwhich can be\na way in\nwhich we\nsort of read\nthat I am\ncaring,\nbecause I'm\nso distraught\nover something\nin relationship\nto you or\nsomething,\nand that\nthat distress,\nthat worry,\nthat suffering\nis sort of,\nI take as the\nsign of my\ncaring.\nBut what\nwe see is\nthat it\nactually\nobstructs our\ncaring,\nbecause in\nthat suffering,\nit becomes\nmore and more\nabout me,\nbecause I'm\nsuffering,\nso it's\nharder to\nsee outside\nof that,\nbeyond that.\nSo it's\nactually in\ntrue non-attachment\nthat that\ncompassion can\ncome forth\nmuch more\nprofoundly.\nif we can\nsee this\none and\nbe absolutely\nclear about\nthem,\nit would be\nlike coming\nupon our\nown parent\nat the\ncrossroads,\nmeeting for\nthe first\ntime again.\nThis\nwisdom,\nwhat the\nBuddha\nrealizes,\nthis wisdom\nis so deep\nwithin us,\nit's not\neven,\nthere's no\nway to talk\nabout it,\nit's not\ndeep within,\nlike deep\nmeans where\nexactly,\nhatha,\ntoes,\nwithin,\nas opposed\nto where\nwas it\nbefore,\nthere's\nreally no\nway to\ntalk about\nit,\nand so we\ntalk about\nit a lot,\nright,\nto try and\nget it right,\nor as close\nto right as\nwe can,\nbecause we\nhave to\ncommunicate,\nthe Buddha\nhad to\nteach,\nand had to\ntry and\nconvey,\nsomething,\nthat if\ndone well,\nactually points\nin the right\ndirection,\nand also\nconfuses us,\npoints in the\nright direction,\nand also\npoints in\nanother\ndirection as\nwell.\nAnd so\nthis,\nwhat we\ncall Buddha\nnature,\nwhat we\ncall our\nself-nature,\nthis one,\nthat\nShakyamuni\nand Maitre\nare the\nservants\nof,\nwhen we\nmeet them,\nwe meet\nthem again,\nfor the\nfirst time.\nThey've never\nbeen anywhere\nelse,\nwhich means\nwe have to\nlet go of\nthe many,\nmany versions\nof ourselves\nand others\nthat we\ncarry around\nwith us.\nand so\nfor some\nmoment we\nhave to\nforget the\nface and\nthe voice\nand the\nmemory\nand see.\nThat's why\nMaster spoke\nof the\npractice of\nstopping\nand seeing.\nwe have to\nstop.\nWe have to\ninterrupt\nthis\ntrajectory,\nthis\ninvolvement\nthat we\nare in the\nmidst of all\nthe time in\nour mind,\nin our\nconsciousness,\nin our\ntrying to\nlive our\nlife in\nthe best\nway possible.\nTo stop\nand see.\nAnd to\nsee,\nto actually\nsee,\nwe have to\nsee beyond\nwhat my\nmind has\nbeen taught\nto see\nand what\nI have\ntaken on\nand created\nmyself to\nsee and\ncalled the\nworld.\nI have to\nsee through\nthat.\nI have to\nlet that\nfall away.\nThat's why\nwe do\nZasad.\nOne\nreason we\ndo Zasad.\nAs I spoke\nabout on\nFriday night,\nhow do we\nrealize that\nwe're dreaming\nin the middle\nof a dream?\nthe faith\nmind says\nwhen love\nand hate\nare both\nabsent,\nthen the\nway becomes\nclear and\nundisguised.\nWhen we\nare no\nlonger\nrejecting,\npushing away,\ndenying,\navoiding,\nbut we're\nalso no\nlonger getting\ntangled up\nin essentially\nwords and\nthoughts and\nideas about\nsomething.\nWhat it\nis,\nwhy it\nis,\nwhose fault\nit is.\nbecause those\nthings only\nlead to\nthose things\nover and\nover.\nAnd so\nZasad is\nstopping,\nwhich means\nwe have to\nbecome very\nadept at\nwhat does\nthat mean.\nBecause the\nway we will\nbe inclined\nto stop\nis through\naversion.\nRight?\nWe just\ntake that\nimpulse,\nwe already\nknow how\nto do\nthat.\nOkay,\nso I\napply that\nto my\nthoughts.\nI stop\nthem,\nI deny\nthem,\nI avoid\nthem,\nthat's how\nI develop\nmindfulness.\nWrong.\nBut we\ncan't be\npassive,\notherwise\nthey keep\ngoing.\nAnd so\nwe are\nmet with\none of\nmany,\nmany,\nwhat I\ncall these\ndynamic\nnecessary\ntensions.\nNot\ndenying\nand not\nclinging.\nWhat\nFayan is\ntrying to\ndo here\nis actually\nmake you\nuncomfortable\nin a good\nway.\nDisturb you\na little bit.\nThat's why\nthis koan in\na Western\ncontext,\nI think\nit would\nbe difficult\nfor most\nof us as\nWesterners to\ntruly experience\nthis in the way\nthat it might\nhave been\nexperienced\ntraditionally.\nIt doesn't\nmean it's not\nuseful and\nthis can't\nstill be\nhelpful and\npowerful.\nBut a lot\nof these\nteachings are\nintended to\nactually get\nour attention\nto, wait,\nwhat?\nTo startle\nus, to\nstop, to\nraise doubt\nwithin it.\nWhich means\nto not doubt\nyour eyes,\nyour ears,\nyour senses,\nbut to\ndoubt our\nconsciousness,\nto question\nwhat is going\non in my\nmind once\nmy eyes\ntouch a\nvisual object.\nWhat is\ngoing on in\nmy mind once\nmy ears\ntouch an\naudible object?\nWhat happens\nthen?\nHow does it\nget all\nturned around?\nThat is to\nquestion the\nmind that\nperceives and\nelaborates and\nprojects.\nWhen I was\nin North\nCarolina, I\nvisited my\nfamily recently.\nA family\nmember is\nin a\nlittle\ntwo-person\nband\nwith his\npartner.\nChimon's\nbrother, and\nwe went to\nlisten.\nWe were in\na beer\ngarden, so\nwe were\nlistening to\nthem play.\nIt was\ngreat.\nAnd I\nwatched this\nguy, I\nwas seeing\nthis guy\nwho was\nstanding up\ndrinking a\nbeer and\nhe had a\nt-shirt on,\nand it had a\npicture of the\nflag, and\nfor every\nstripe was a\ngun.\nAnd so I'm\njust taking it\nin, you\nknow, a\nstatement here.\nYou know, a\nvery strong\nstatement.\nAnd then I\nlooked at\nhis face.\nHe didn't\nlook very\nhappy.\nHe looked\nalone,\nlonely.\nAnd it\nwas like,\nthere's\nsomething going\non here,\nand there's\nsomething going\non here.\nThere are\nso many\nmoments that\nshould bring\nus doubt.\nWe should\nwonder.\nWe should\nquestion.\nThe\ncommentary,\nShibiyama says\nabout this,\nhe says,\ngreat doubt\nquestioning the\nnature of\nthings,\nquestioning\nsamsara.\nlike, is\nthis really\nit?\nIs this\nthe best we\ncan do?\nIs this the\nbest we've\ncome up\nwith?\nWhy doesn't\nit work?\nTo raise\nthat great\ndoubt,\nand Shibiyama\nsays that\ngreat doubt\nand realization\nof the\ntrue nature\nof the\none are\ntwo sides\nof the\nsame coin.\nThey work\ntogether.\nAnd Old\nMaster says,\nunder the\ngreat doubt\nis great\nrealization.\nIf the\nmountain is\nhigh, the\nvalley is\ndeep.\nIf the\nobject is\nlarge, its\nshadow is\nalso large.\nShibiyama\nsays, inquire,\ninquire, examine\nexhaustively, until\nthe whole\nuniverse is one\ngreat mass\nof doubt.\nAt this\nextremity, if\nyou do not\nstop but go\non doubting and\ninquiring, when\nthe opportunity\nis ripe, the\ntime will come\nwhen that doubt\nwill be broken\nthrough, and\nwe will see.\nAnd this\nis a sort\nof a way\nof, and\nit's not\nunique to\nZen, but\nit's sort\nof became\npart of the\nteachings around\nthe koan,\nbecause the\nkoan gives\nyou something\nthat causes\ndoubt, that\nprovokes, that\nraises a\nquestion, that\nneeds to be\nresolved.\nThat's the\nnature of it.\nAnd the\nstudent takes\nthat into\ntheir meditation\nand focuses,\nbut it needs\nto be embodied.\nThey need to\nwant to know.\nThey have to\nwant to inquire.\nIt can't be a\ncasual thing.\nYou know, like\nwhat's the\nweather today?\nIt has to\nbe, as\nis said, like\na fire on\ntop of your\nhead.\nLike my\nlife depends\non it.\nAnd in that\nthere's a\ntremendous amount\nof energy, and\nwhat it's doing\nis sort of\nharnessing all\nof that deep\npain, about\nexistence, that\nmany of us\nwould rather\njust ignore,\nshop over\nit.\nBut rather,\nit's actually\npulling that up\nand saying,\nno, let's\nfan that, let's\nbring that into\nfull flame.\nIt's too\nimportant to\nwaste.\nwaste.\nHow do we\nuse it?\nThis is one\nway.\nAnd that, it's\nnot dependent\nupon a\nkoan.\nAnd it's\ninteresting that\nin the\nteachings, in\nthe teachings of\nthe mental\nfactor, doubt\nis spoken of\nin a different\nway.\nThere, doubt\nis a\nhindrance.\nTo doubt, it's\nsaid, is to be\nof two minds\nto not\nknow, to\nnot be\nclear.\nIs it\nthis or is\nit that?\nTo be\nunclear.\nAnd it\nsaid that it\nfunctions as\na basis for\nnot engaging\nin virtue.\nBecause I'm\ndoubtful, I\ndon't know what\nto do.\nI don't know\nwhich way to\ngo, so I\ndon't commit.\nI can't\nengage.\nI can't be\nwholehearted.\nIt's a\ndifferent use\nof that\nword.\nMaster\nDawe said,\nright where\nyou stand,\nexamine the\none in you\nwho covets\nwealth and\nrank.\nAnd in\nthat you\ncould replace\nit with\nanything that\nyou covet.\nWhere does\nthat person\ncome from\nwho covets\nthose things?\nAnd where\nin the future\nwill they\ngo?\nWhere are\nthey right\nnow in\nthis moment\nof wanting?\nAnd where\nare they\ngoing?\nAnd then\nTawe says,\nsince you\ndon't know,\nyour mind\nwill feel\nconfused and\nunhappy.\nIn\nsamsara,\nwe just\ncovet more.\nWe\ndistract\nourselves.\nBut\nDawe is\nsaying,\nno,\nright there,\nit's not\nsomeone else's\naffair.\nRight\nthere is\nwhere you\nbring your\nclear mind.\nRight\nthere in\nthat confusion\nis a\npathway,\nis a\ndoorway.\nWe tend\nto read\nthose experiences\nwe have\nas something\nthat is\nwrong.\nThey are\nuncomfortable.\nAnd that's\njust a\nbasic aspect\nof the\npath.\nWe have\nto develop\nthe capacity\nto be\nuncomfortable\nfreely,\nknowingly.\nWe're\nalready\nuncomfortable.\nNobody\ncomes into\nZen practice\nbecause they\nare so\ncomfortable.\nRight?\nOr they're\nhaving such\na good\ntime.\nOr\neverything\nis so\ngreat.\nRight?\nso it's\nreally\njust,\nit's\nlike\nmeeting\nus\nat\nthe\ndoor\nand\nsaying,\nyes,\nyes,\nyes,\nwe\nunderstand.\nYou\nunderstand?\nYou\nactually\nunderstand\nthat?\nThat's\nthe way\nI felt\nwhen I\nfirst\nencountered\nthe\nDharma.\nIt's\nlike,\noh,\nmy\nGod,\nyou\nunderstand\nthis.\nYou're\nactually\ngiving it\nlanguage.\nYou're\nputting\nwords\nto it.\nRight\nhere is\nwhere you\nbring your\nclear mind,\nwhich\nmeans\nwe have\nto get\nour mind\nclear.\nWe have\nto return\nto that\nclear mind.\nWe have\nto practice.\nWho\nis this\none\nwho is\nconfused?\nWho\nis this\none who\nseeks\nto be\nnot\nconfused,\nto be\nat\npeace?\nShibiyam\nsays,\nthe\nancient\nmasters\nwere\nnever\ntired\nof\npointing\nout\nthat\nthis\none\nwho\nhas\nsuch\nakimuni\nand\nMaitreya\nas their\nservants\nis not\nsomebody\nstanding\nover\nagainst\nI.\nThat\nthey\nare the\none\nwho is\nalone\nin the\nuniverse\naccompanied\nby\nanything.\nThat\nthey\nare the\ntrue\nperson\nof no\ntitle,\nno\nrank.\nThat\nthey\nare\nthe\nmaster\nor\nabsolute\nsubjectivity.\nThat\nthey\nare\none's\noriginal\ntrue\nself.\nThat\nthe\nteacher\nis\nnever\ntired\nof\nsaying\nthis\nin\nall\nof\nthese\ndifferent\nways.\nHowever\nprecisely\nyou may\ndescribe\nthis\none,\nyou\nwill\nmiss\nthem.\nIf\nyou\never\ntry\nto\ndescribe\nthem\nat\nall,\nyou\nhave\nto\ngrasp\nthem\nand\nbe\nthem\nyourself\nif\nyou\nwant\nto\nreally\nknow\nthem.\nBut how\ndo you\ngrasp\nwhat's\nungraspable?\nHow do\nyou be\nthat very\none that\nyou already\nare?\nIf I'm\nalready\nthat one,\nwhy aren't\nI already\nenlightened?\nwhy aren't\nI manifesting\nthe wisdom\nof the\nBuddha,\nthe\ncompassion\nof\nAvril\nKiteshvara?\nLike,\nwhat gives?\nAnd so\nwe practice\nto\ngo into\nthat\nconfusion,\nwhich\ndoesn't\nmean\nsit\ndown\nand\nconjure\nup\nconfusion.\nJust hang\naround,\nit'll\ncome.\nThat's\none of\nthe\nnice\nimportant\nthings\nabout\nZazen\nis that\nyou don't\nbring an\nagenda,\nyou just\nbring your\npractice.\nThat's why\nit's\nimportant to\nknow what\nis your\nroot\npractice,\nwhat is\nit that\nyou do\nwhen you\nsit on\nthat\ncushion.\nAnd\nthen you\ngive\nyourself\nto\nthat,\nand\nthen the\nself\narises\nin\nvarious\nmoments,\nand in\nthose\nmoments,\nit\narises\nbecause\nit's\ntime.\nAnd\nthat\nthe\ncauses\nof\nthat\nself\narising\nin\nthat\nmoment\nhave\nripened.\nAnd\noftentimes\nit's\nvery,\nvery\ntiny\nlittle\nfruit,\nright?\nNot\nmuch to\nbite into,\nso you\njust drop\nit.\nSometimes\nit's\nmuch\nlarger,\nmore\nsignificant.\nAnd\nTawai\nis saying,\nand all\nof the\nmasters\nhave said,\nthis is\nthe point\nthat you\nenter.\nWhat\ndoes\nthat\nmean?\nDon't\ndeny it.\ndon't\nwrite a\nscript.\nIn a\nsense,\nthat's\nall we\nhave to\nknow.\nWe\ndon't\nhave to\nalready\nhave an\nidea of\nwhat's\nnext,\nbecause\nthat's\njust\nanother\nidea.\nWe're\nwriting a\nscript.\nDiscover.\nTrust\nyour

not\ndraw another\nperson's\nbow,\ndo not\nride another\nperson's\nhorse,\ndo not\ndefend another\nperson's\nfault,\ndo not\ninquire into\nanother\nperson's\naffairs.\nSo how\ndoes this\nsquare with\nthe vow\nto alleviate\nall\nsuffering?\nIt sounds\nlike kind\nof isolated,\nisolated,\nright?\nDon't get\ninto anybody\nelse's\nbusiness,\nbecause there\nis that\naspect of\npractice,\nbecause we\nget into\neverybody's\nbusiness,\nand they\ndon't even\nknow it.\nRight?\nHow many\npeople's\nbusiness did\nyou get\ninto in\nthis hall\nover this\nweekend,\nand they\ndidn't even\nknow it?\nRight?\nAnd so it\nmade me think\nof the\nLojong\nphrases,\nslogans\nof Atisha.\nOne of\nthem is,\nof the two\nwitnesses,\nhold the\nprincipal one.\nAnd Judy\nLee says,\nthis is about\naloneness\nand confidence.\nBeing confident\nin your\nsolitude.\nShe says,\nit gets to a\ncore issue\non the path\nof practice,\nwhich is the\nfact that\neach of us\nmust travel\nthis alone.\nOf course,\nwe may be\nin a community\nin a sangha\nif we're\nfortunate.\nWe may be\nin one\ntradition,\nand so\non.\nBut we\ncome in\nalone,\nwe go\nout\nalone,\nand in\nbetween,\nno matter\nhow many\nfriends and\nacquaintances\nwe have,\nwe are\nstill alone\nat a\nfundamental\nlevel.\nAnd I\nthink for\nmany of\nus,\nthat is\nfrightening.\nSomeone in\nmy family,\nI know,\nI don't know\nif they're\nstill doing\nit for a\nlong time,\nwhen they\nwould come\nhome,\nthey would\njust turn\non the\nTV.\nThey\ndidn't\nsit\ndown\nto watch\nTV.\nTo not\nbe alone.\nSo what\nhappens when\nyou come\ninto practice\nis we\ngive you\na seat\nand we\nsay,\ngoodbye.\nYou're\nalone.\nYou\nactually\ncame that\nway.\nBut now,\nknow\nthat.\nKnow\nthat\naloneness.\nBecause it's\nsomething you\nshare with\nevery other\nhuman being.\nand in\nthat,\nthere is\nconfidence.\nThere is\nstrength.\nThere is\nreally all\nof the\nvirtuous\nqualities\nthat we\nalready\npossess.\nShe says,\nit's hard\nto accept\nthis kind\nof existential\naloneness\nin ourselves\nor in\nothers.\nWe want\npeople to\nknow us.\nWe want\nto have\nsome way\nof truly\nunderstanding\nothers.\nBut no\nmatter how\nmuch we\nbear our\nhearts,\nwe can\nnever fully\nconvey the\nexperience that\nwe're having\nin any\nparticular\nmoment.\nWe try\nand we\nshould.\nI mean,\nwould there\nbe art\nwithout that?\nMusic,\npoetry,\ndance,\nto express\nwhat's\nhappening\nand to\nshare that\nand to be\nenlivened\nand enriched\nby that\nand to\nknow at\nthe same\ntime,\nI have\nonly been\nable to\nshare so\nmuch.\nI\ncan't\nshare\nthe\nrest.\nNeither\ncan you.\nAnd that's\nnot a\nproblem.\nIt's not\na mistake.\nIt's the\nnature of\nour\nexistence.\nAnd so\ndo not\ndraw another\nperson's\nbow.\nDo not\nride another\nperson's\nhorse.\nDraw your\nown bow.\nRide your\nown horse.\nLive in\nyour own\nbody.\nPractice\nyour own\nmind.\nDo not\ninquire into\nanother\nperson's\naffairs.\nWhy do\nwe do\nthat?\nSo there's\nanother\nslogan.\nDon't\nponder\nothers.\nBecause of\nthe two\nwitnesses\nholding the\nprincipal one,\nit's hard.\nRight?\nThat's\nuncomfortable.\nSo what do\nI do?\nI ponder\nsomebody else.\nRight?\nI don't\nthink I\ndon't reflect\non me.\nI reflect\non you.\nAnd there\nis so much\nto reflect\non about\nyou.\nI mean,\nI'm not\nkidding.\nRight?\nI could\nwrite a\nbook.\nIn fact,\nand so\nthis\nslogan\nis\ndon't\nponder\nothers.\nIt's\npretty\nclear.\nJudy\nLeaves\nsays\nit's\nsimilar\nto\nthe\nother\nhold\nthe\nprincipal\none\noneself\nin
