  "transcript": "Thank you for being here this weekend and being part of this Donna Weekend, the heart of which will take place tomorrow.\nAnd our teachers for the weekend will be arriving tomorrow in buses from all over the county.\nAnd I'd like to take this opportunity tonight to clarify a little bit about what Donna really is.\nWe translate it as giving, but giving doesn't reach it at all.\nAnd we have that problem with the English language and translating some of these Buddhist terms into English because the English versions of them, the closest English word to them, has totally different meanings.\nAnd as a result, they become misinterpreted.\nAnd that's why many of them we retain in the original form, such as Donna.\nDonna is one of the paramitas.\nThere are six paramitas.\nAnd these paramitas have been in existence a long time.\nThey're part of Mahayana Buddhism, which Zen is a part of.\nAnd Donna is the first of those.\nAnd each one of the paramitas, when you try to translate them, you somehow miss what they're about.\nFor example, we translate Prajna paramita.\nParamita literally means other shore or to cross over.\nAnd our way of understanding crossing over to the other shore in Zen is that the other shore arrives, or indeed, that the other shore is right here, right now.\nPrajna, we translate as wisdom.\nAnd wisdom, if you look it up in a dictionary, talks about accumulating knowledge.\nIt's not what Prajna means.\nIt has nothing to do with knowledge, nor does it have anything to do with knowing.\nSo that the calling it wisdom misses it.\nThe same with the word Karuna, we translate as compassion.\nCompassion has a sense of empathy about it, which implies self and other.\nIn compassion, there is no dualism.\nThere is no self or other.\nAnd we translate dana as giving.\nAnd that, too, misses the point.\nBecause giving is not dana.\nNot quite dana.\nThere can be no dana, unless there is both giving and receiving occurring simultaneously.\nSo that the giver and the receiver are unified.\nThey become one thing.\nIt's the same with compassion.\nThere's no doer or the thing that you're doing to.\nThere's no effort or even sense of it occurring.\nCompassion happens the way your hair grows.\nIt's spontaneous.\nThere's no knowledge of it.\nSo dana is not charity.\nAnd it's not generosity.\nAnd it's not almsgiving or donation or beneficence or benevolence or benefaction.\nIt's not contribution or gift or philanthropy or offering.\nBut rather, it's the practice of total, unequivocal relinquishment.\nWhat is relinquishment?\nWhat does that mean?\nThe great master, Hui Hai, who was a successor of Basso, talked about it in a dialogue with one of his monks.\nThe monk asked, by what means can the gateway of our school be entered?\nThe master said, by means of dana paramita.\nAccording to the Buddha and the Bodhisattva path, the monk said,\nthe Bodhisattva path consists of six paramitas.\nWhy then have you mentioned only one?\nPlease explain why this one alone provides a sufficient means for us to enter.\nThe master said, deluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from dana paramita\nand that it's by practice, by its practice, that all others are fulfilled.\nWhy it's the first one of the paramitas.\nWhy is it called dana paramita?\nThe answer, dana means relinquishment.\nQuestion, relinquishment of what?\nAnswer, relinquishment of dualism of opposites.\nWhat does that mean?\nThe monk asked.\nIt means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,\nbeing and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,\nconcentration and distraction, pure and impure.\nBy giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.\nThe real practice of dana paramita entails achieving this state without any thought of,\nnow I see that opposites are void, or now I have relinquished all of them.\nWe may also call it the simultaneous cutting off of the myriad types of current cause.\nFor it is when these are cut off that the whole dharma nature becomes void, empty.\nAnd this emptiness of the dharma nature means the non-dwelling of the mind upon anything whatsoever.\nOnce that state is achieved, not a single form can be discerned.\nWhy?\nBecause our self-nature is non-existent and does not contain a single thing foreign to itself.\nThat which contains no single thing is true reality, the marvelous form of the Tathagatha.\nIt's said in the Diamond Sutra,\nthose who relinquish all forms are called Buddhas, or enlightened ones.\nSo basically what he's saying is that dana is about forgetting the self.\nWhen there's no self, there's no other.\nThis is the diamond net of Indra, where all things are interconnected,\nwhere all things are codependent,\nwhere all things nourish each other and themselves.\nWho forget the self is body and mind fallen away.\nIn our practice, giving and receiving is at the heart of almost everything that we do.\nThat's what our service is about.\nOur liturgy is about.\nWe receive the teachings and we return gratitude.\nWe receive food and we acknowledge.\nTherefore, we eat this food with everyone.\nWe eat to stop all evil, to practice good.\nWhat's the next line?\nSave all sentient beings and to accomplish the Buddha way.\nSo the receiving of the food, it's taken with the intent of giving, to follow it.\nWe receive the teachings and we give.\nWe return it.\nSo giving and receiving, the heart of that in Japanese Buddhism,\nthey have the practice of takahatsu.\nAnd there they try to recreate that practice of giving and receiving,\nwhere the monk begs for food and receives food\nand then gives a chance something for the person that's given them the food.\nAnd it's in that giving and receiving that these two people are unified.\nSo the giving and receiving is constantly a manifestation of the interrelatedness,\ncodependency, mutual causality of the diamond net of Indra,\nin which all things, every speck of dust in this vast universe is interrelated,\nis codependent, has a mutual causality.\nWhat happens to one thing happens to the totality of it.\nPast, present, future.\nThat diamond net exists in the three dimensions of space\nas well as the fourth dimension of time.\nIt's because that there's both giving and receiving happening simultaneously\nthat it's never exhausted.\nWhen it's really happening that way, it's never exhausted.\nAnd that's why I've always felt that it's essential to people in the helping professions\nto really understand what they're doing.\nIf they're not receiving while they're giving,\nif they're doing something for somebody else,\nif they're helping somebody else or saving somebody else,\nit's all going in one direction.\nIf they have not yet understood that they are receiving,\nthat there's a possibility to be received, to receive something.\nThere is a mutual nourishment.\nThere is a mutual healing.\nHealer and the healed are both healed in the process.\nAnd when you understand that, you don't exhaust anything.\nIt's endless, boundless.\nWhen I think back at the teachers that I've known in my time of practice,\nI've seen that.\nThe real teachers have boundless energy, people say.\nYou know, what's the reservoir?\nWhere does it come from?\nWhat do they plug into?\nWell, they're plugged into the center of the universe itself.\nThat's where the nourishment comes from.\nIt's by the giving and receiving happening simultaneously.\nAsatani Roshi was 88 years old or 89 years old.\nVery, very sick.\nClose to the end of his life.\nGaunt, weak, trembling.\nHe had to be helped by two Jesus to go to this Jukai ceremony.\nThe last Jukai ceremony that he did the day before he died.\nAnd he couldn't even do his bows.\nThey helped him to his seat.\nHis voice was very weak as he introduced the whole thing.\nAnd he offered the incense and began the ceremony.\nAnd a lion appeared.\nHis voice became strong.\nThe power of his presence enveloped the entire group of people.\nHe completed the Jukai ceremony as if he were 30 years old instead of 88 years old.\nAnd then relapsed into his being very weak and helped out of the place and everything.\nThat Jukai ceremony was filling him with energy.\nWhat he was giving, he was receiving.\nThe next day, he never got out of bed.\nHe asked his attendant at one point while she was preparing breakfast to sit him up in bed\nso he could sit in a Zazen posture.\nWhen she came back, she found him dead.\nWhere did that energy come from?\nIt came from the very process of dhana.\nAnd all of what we do is dhana.\nDogen says,\nThe self gives the self for the sake of giving the self.\nThe other gives the other for the sake of giving the other.\nGiving is purposeless.\nThe karmic force of such giving prevails as far as the heavenly world and the human world.\nSo it's not dhana unless it's non-dual, no separation.\nDogen talks about dhana in terms of loving words,\nworking for the welfare of all beings,\nand identity with others.\nAnd his words are the best way of expressing them.\nHe says,\nLoving speech means that as you meet sentient beings,\nyou first arouse a sense of compassion in your mind\nand treat them with considerate and affectionate words.\nPraise the virtuous.\nHave compassion on the wicked.\nAs you take delight in affectionate words,\nthey will gradually flourish,\nand then even those loving words,\nwhich were hitherto unknown and unperceived,\nwill begin to reveal themselves.\nThen he says,\nin terms of working for the welfare of all beings,\nhe said,\nWorking for the welfare of all beings\nmeans that you contrive ways to benefit\nall sentient beings, high and low.\nThe practice of benefiting others is the total truth.\nHence, it serves both self and other far and wide.\nTherefore, serve enemies and friends equally\nand assist self and other without discrimination.\nIf you grasp this truth,\nyou will see that this is the reason\nthat even grass and trees,\nthe wind and water,\nare all naturally engaged in the activity\nof benefiting others.\nAnd your understanding will certainly serve\nothers' benefit.\nAnd then he says,\nIdentity with others.\nIdentity with others is non-differentiation,\nnon-duality.\nThis applies equally to the self and to others.\nThere is a truth that after the self\nassimilates the other to itself,\nthe self lets itself be assimilated to the other.\nThis relationship of self and other\nis infinitely varied according to the circumstances.\nSo, what Dogen's talking about,\nwhat dana is directing itself to,\nis the heart of being,\nthe vast net of existence\nthat we call the diamond net,\nthe virtue of and harmony\nof the universe itself.\nThis is the nature\nof all beings,\nof all sentient beings.\nIt's there.\nEach one of us has that\nability, that potential.\nbut somehow\nwe cover it.\nWe cover it by our conditioning.\nWe cover it by our ideas\nand notions.\nBy our sense,\nthe illusion of separateness.\nThere are many ways\nto get to that.\nAnd of course,\nthe heart of\nand most important way\nto get there is Zazen.\nZazen just peels back\nthe layers of those conditioning.\nThat conditioning\nand underneath it\nin that ground of being\nis\nthe perfection of giving.\nIt's part of\nour human characteristic.\nIt's part of\nwhat it means\nto be human.\nIt's part of\nwhat it means\nto be alive.\nTo be part of\nthis great earth,\nall of it\nis constantly\ngiving\nand receiving.\nEvery aspect of it,\nevery atom,\nevery molecule.\nThere would be\nno life\nif it weren't\nfor that\ngiving and receiving,\nthat codependency.\nEven if you\ngo down to\na molecular\nor atomic level,\nthe relationship\nbetween atoms\nthat makes a molecule,\nthat makes water,\nis giving\nand receiving.\nIt shares\nthe electrons.\nIt shares\nthe protons.\nIt creates\nan entity\nby the act\nof giving\nand receiving.\nAnd so it is\nfrom the molecular\natomic level\nto the most\ncomplex organisms,\nincluding the universe\nitself.\nHow can we ignore it?\nHow can we not\nunderstand\nthat it's part\nof what it means\nto be in harmony\nwith the nature\nof things?\nThe spring breeze\nwarms the earth\nand brings the rain.\nThe earth offers up\nplants and vegetation.\nAll of the earth's\ncreatures\nbreathe\nthe sweet air\nthat's produced\nby this,\nfeed on the bounty\nthat's produced\nby this,\nand then they return\nit to the earth.\nIsn't all of that\ndana?\ngiving\nand receiving\nin unity.\nThat's what\nthis weekend\nis about.\nAll of what\nI said\nare the words\nand the ideas\nthat describe it.\nTomorrow\nyou will have\nan opportunity\nto experience\nit\nyourself,\nto practice\nit\nyourself.\nYou won't\neven\ntaste it\nor get\na glimmering\nof it\nif there's\nany\nself-centeredness\ninvolved\nin what you\ndo.\nAbandon\nthe self.\nForget\nthe self\nlike you do\nin Zazen\nand give\nfreely.\nGive yourself\nfreely.\nGive yourself\naway\nfreely.\nYour heart,\nyour body,\nyour labor,\nyour presence,\nyour love,\nyour ear,\nwhatever\nis needed.\nAnd if you\ndo that,\nyou'll find\nout\nwhat the\nAsatani\nRoshi\nknew\nfor many,\nmany years.\nYou'll find\nout for\nyourself.\nSo,\nagain,\nthank you\nfor your\nwillingness\nwillingness to\nbe here,\nto participate\nin this\npractice of\ndana.\nWhat happens\nnext,\nboss?\nOh,\nall right.\nI didn't\nwant to,\nI was late,\nand I'm\nsorry I was\nlate.\nI was\nbusily making\nnotes and\nlost track of\nthe time.\nYeah,\ngo ahead.\nAny questions?\nAny questions?\nPeter?\nOh.\nOkay.\nBe easy on\nme,\nPeter.\nLast time\nyou chewed\nme up.\nIs\nthe\ndana dinner\nChristmas\npeople\nwho don't\nhave\nChristmas\nor is\nit just\nfor\ndana dinner?\nWell,\nwhat does\ndana dinner\nmean to\nyou?\nWhen you\nsay,\nor is it\njust\ndana dinner?\nSo,\nI need to\nknow what\nyou mean\nby just\ndana dinner.\nI mean,\nis it just\nlike that?\nIs it just\na thing\nthat's\nactually,\nI mean,\nwhat I've\nbeen saying,\nand let me\nsay it again\nin a little\nbit of a\ndifferent way,\nwhat it\nis for us\nas Buddhists\nhere is\na way to\nlearn for\nourselves\nwhat the\nBuddha was\ntalking about,\nwhat the\nBuddha's\nteachings\nmeant when\nthey talked\nabout\ndana,\nthat dana\nis an\nact of\ngiving and\nreceiving at\nthe same\ntime.\nIt's like\nwhen you\nstub your\ntoe,\nit needs\nhelp,\nand you\nimmediately\ngive,\nyou grab\nyour foot\nand you\nhop around\nsaying,\nooh,\nooh,\nooh,\nand then\nyou receive,\nyou start\nfeeling better.\nYou\ngive the\nnourishment,\nyou know,\nyou stroke\nyourself,\nand you\nreceive it\nsimultaneously.\nso that's\nwhat giving\nand receiving\ndana means\nto a\nBuddhist.\nAnd\nwhat we\nwant to\nlearn this\nweekend\nis how in\nthis process\nof getting\ntogether with\nall these\npeople\nto make\nthat work.\nAnd if we\ncan make it\nwork here,\nyou know,\nbeing very\naware of it\nand conscious\nof it,\nmaybe then\nwe can\nmake it\nwork in\nthe world.\nSo it's\nnot the\nsame as\nwalking along\nand there's\nsome poor\nguy on the\nside of the\nroad that\nsays,\ndo you\nhave a\nquarter for\na cup of\ncoffee?\nAnd you\nsay,\nsure,\nhere.\nAnd they\nsay,\noh,\nthank you\nvery much.\nYou say,\nit's okay.\nAnd they\ngo have a\ncup of\ncoffee.\nThat's\ncharity.\nSo it's\nnot charity.\nYou know,\nit's not\nbeing a\nbenefactor.\nIt's not\nmaking\nyourself\nhigher,\nbigger,\nor more\nimportant.\nSee,\nwhen you\nhelp somebody,\nusually that\nperson is\ndown and\nout and\nyou're\nbigger and\nstronger.\nDonna makes\nyou the\nsame and\nthen completely\nmerged into\none thing.\nSo there's\nonly Peter\nin the whole\nuniverse.\nHe's swallowed\nup everything.\nOkay?\nAnyone else?\nWhy do we do\nit at Christmas?\nWe're actually,\nI mean,\nChristmas,\nthat holiday\ntime is,\nI mean,\nso obviously\nuniversal.\nYou know,\nthey even make\na big deal\nout of it in\nJapan now.\nAnd as time\ngoes on and\nthe earth\ngets smaller,\nall the\ncountries are\ndoing it,\neven without\nany relationship\nto Christmas.\nwhat they've\nimported is\nthe worst\nof what\nthe whole\nthing is\nabout.\nI mean,\nthe whole\nconcept of\nChrist and\nChristianity,\nand it's the\nCatholic Church's\nfault for\ndoing that.\nChrist wasn't\nborn in\nDecember.\nHe was born\nin March.\nHe's a\nPisces.\nI have it\nfrom,\nyeah,\nyeah,\nhe was.\nI knew he\nwasn't a\nCapricorn.\nRight.\nRight.\nI mean,\nmost of the,\nI mean,\nBuddha was a\nPisces too.\nGurjeev,\nI mean,\na lot of\npeople,\nspiritual\npeople.\nso what's\nhappened is\nwhat happened\nis that\nthe Druids\nhad this\npagan holiday\nwhich all\nthe things\nthat we\ncall Christmas\nthat people\nknow as\nChristmas,\ngiving of\ngifts,\nthe mistletoe,\nthe office\nparty,\ngetting\ndrunk,\nall those\nthings were\npart of\nthat\nfeast\nof the\nDruids\nand people\ncontinued to\ndo it\nand so\nthe Catholic\nChurch\nmoved the\nholiday\nto that\ntime\nhoping to\novercome it\nwith the\nforce of\nthe birth of\nChrist and so\non but what\nhappened is\nthey merged\nand became\na kind of\na mixture\nof both.\nSame thing\nwith Halloween.\nHalloween,\nI was reading\na thing,\nI don't know\nhow true it\nis,\nit was put\nout by the\nborn again\nChristians,\nhow evil\nHalloween is\nand that\nit's really\ndevil worshippers\nand so on\nand they\ntraced the\nholiday back\nalso to a\nDruid thing\nand it had\nto do with\nthe rising\nof the dead\nand the\nworship of\ndemons\nand stuff\nlike that\nand there\nwas a lot\nmore to it\nand they\nmade that\nHallow Eve\nAll Saints\nDay\nand that\ntoo\nended up\nkind of\na merge\nthing.\nSo what\nI'd like to\nsee us do\nwith that\nsame thing\nand actually\nwe do this\nclose to the\nsolstice,\nthe winter\nsolstice,\nI mean clearly\nthe winter\nsolstice is a\ntime for\ncelebration.\nAll cultures\ncelebrate the\nvarious solstice\nholidays and\nequinoxes\nbecause there\nare times of\ntransition\nand here\nthe solstice,\nthe days will\nbegin to get\nlonger and\nthe approach\nof spring\nis a cause\nfor celebration\nand my\nproblem with\nit is that\nit has become\nso awful\nto go down\nto the mall\nand to see\nthe looks on\npeople's faces\nthey're in pain\nthey're in agony\nand then to see\nwhat happens\nwith the gifts\nit's a gesture\nit's not really\neven giving\nnot even in the\nremotest thing\nfor the most\npart\nand I'd like\nto see what\nthe garbage\ndumps look like\na week after\nChristmas\nwith all the\nthings that get\nthrown away\nand all the\nwaste that's\ncreated because\nof it\nand we're just\nas bad\nI mean we're\nnot much\nbetter\nbut I'm\nhoping this\nyear is where\nit really struck\nme that we\nneed to do\nsomething to\nmake it a\nlittle bit\nmore in\nline with\nwhat our\nunderstanding\nof Dana\nis\nin the\nsame way\nthat you\nknow you\ncan't\nyou can't\nbeat\nthe forces\nof the\nuniverse\nby just\nopposing them\nyou can't\njust throw\nup a barrier\nso for\nexample\nthe media\nhas done\nsome awful\nstuff\nI mean the\nreason there\nis home\nvideo\nand interactive\nCD-ROM\nis because\nof pornography\nthat's what\nif it wasn't\nfor pornography\nthose things\nnever would\nhave been\nborn\nthat's the\nmulti-billion\ndollar industry\nthat's underneath\nit\nso what do\nyou do\nyou say\nokay\nwe won't\nuse CD-ROMs\nand we'll\nnever look\nat a video\nthat's not\nthe answer\nto it\nthe media\nis neutral\nit's the\nartists and\nthe people\nthat put it\ntogether\nthat make\nit what\nit is\nyou know\nit's like\ncondemning\ncotton\nor\nmetal\nbecause it's\nmade into\na gun\nhow can we\nuse these\nthings in\na way that\nnourishes\nrather than\npoisons\nphotography\nis a\nwonderful\nmedia\nit poisons\nbut it also\nnourishes\nand it\nheals\nand it\ndepends on\nhow you\nuse it\nso I\nthink it's\nthe same\nwith a lot\nof things\nin our\nsociety\nthey're not\ngoing to\ngo away\nso how\ncan we\nuse them\nto nourish\nand that's\nbasically what\nwe're exploring\nwith this\nholiday\neverybody's\nalready into\nthe holiday\nand they're\ngoing to do\nit one way\nor another\nand the\npeople that\ncan't do\nit\nbecause of\ncircumstances\nbecause they\ndon't have\nthe luxury\nof choice\nlike we\nhave\nbecome\ndespondent\nand disturbed\nby it\nby not\nhaving that\nso this is\nan opportunity\nto do\nsomething there\nbut to do\nsomething in a\nnourishing way\nmore positive\nway\nI think you\ndo\nI've told\na lot of\nmy students\nhere the\nstory of\nwhen I\nfirst started\nteaching\nit was very\ndifficult for\nme to have\nwhat's called\nan anja\nan attendant\nthat takes\ncare of\nthe teacher\nthe reason\nit was\ndifficult for\nme is that\nmy father\ndied when I\nwas very\nyoung\nand we\nwere pretty\nwell all\nfamily\nand he\nwas a\npolitician\nat the\nstate level\nand my\nmother was\nyou know\nhostess to\nall these\nimportant people\nand everything\nand then he\ndied\ndidn't believe\nin insurance\nyou know\nthis was\n1939\nand so he\nleft us\nbasically\npenniless\nmy mother\nhad to go\nto work\nbut she\nreally didn't\nhave any\nskills\nwomen in\nthose days\ndidn't\nand so\nshe went\nto school\nand worked\nand was\ncleaning house\nand avoiding\nI mean she\nwas just too\nproud to\ntake what\nwas called\nrelief\nsame as\nwelfare\nnow she\nwould never\ntake it\nbut I\nwould find\nher crying\nat night\nbecause she\nwas cleaning\nhouses for\nthe people\nthat she\nwas the\nhostess for\nyears before\nyou know\nshe was a\nhousekeeper\nand it\nreally bothered\nme that\nI mean it\nimprinted me\npretty deeply\nI was nine\nyears old\nlater when I\ngot married\nand was\nmaking a\nlot of\nmoney\nmy wife\nwanted a\nhousekeeper\nand somebody\nwould come in\nand actually\neven cook for\nus and I\nkept resisting\nit and then\nfinally I\nagreed to\ndo it\nand we'd\nhave this\nwoman come\nin who\ncleaned the\nhouse and\nwould feed\nthe kids\nand then\nserve us\nin another\nroom I\nfelt so\nawful you\nknow I\nkept thinking\nof my\nmother just\ncouldn't do\nit you know\nand so we\nfinally stopped\nthat big\narguments over\nit so years\nlater I\nbecome a\nteacher and\npart of being\na teacher is\nyou have a\ngroup of\nattendants a\npersonal\nattendant a\nsecretary a\nhousekeeper and\nall that but\nI wasn't going to\ndo that\nand so one\nday my\nteacher was\nvisiting me\nand we're\nat the\nhouse and\nI'm running\naround serving\nhim cooking\ngetting his\nready he\nsays I\ndon't want\nyou to have\nyour Anja do\nthat and I\nhad been his\nAnja and I\nhad been his\nG ship so I\nknew how to do\nit so I said\nno I don't have\nan Anja proudly\na little bit of\npride no I\ndon't have an\nAnja I'm a\nregular guy he\nsaid how can\nyou be so\nselfish\nI said why\nhe said what\ndo you mean\nhe said how\ncan you be so\nselfish and not\nallow your\nstudents to\nserve you to\ngive back to\nyou what you\ngive to them\nand it changed\nmy whole notion\nabout that\nand I suddenly\nstarted doing\nit I'm still\nuncomfortable with\nit but I\nfeel it's an\nimportant part of\nthe whole process\nthat they need\nto otherwise\nthey become\nthieves they\ntake and\ndon't give\nand they\nfeel awful\nabout it\nthey want\nto\nstudents want\nto give\nback\nI know I\ndid when I\nwas serving\nmy teacher\nI felt great\nbut we used\nto fight\nover who\ncould do\nit\nwhat about\nwhat about\nif you're\non the end\nof wanting\nto give\nback\nsay that\nagain\nare you\nstuck\nnot\nhaving\nDonna\nif the\nother person\ndoesn't
