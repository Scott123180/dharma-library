  "transcript": "Four, five, six, seven.\nOnce you have achieved peaceful stillness of body and mind, you must make earnest effort.\nDo not immediately settle down in peaceful stillness.\nIn the teachings, this is called the deep pit of liberation.\nMuch to be feared.\nYou must make yourself turn freely, like a gourd floating on the water, independent and free, not subject to restraints,\nentering purity and impurity without being obstructed or sinking down.\nOnly then do you have a little familiarity with the school of the patch-robed monks.\nIf you just manage to cradle the un-crying child in your arms, what's the use?\nThis is from the collected letters, teaching letters of Master Da Wei, who was one of the successors of Master Ingo back in the 11th, 12th century China.\nIngo is the compiler of the Blue Cliff Record, and Da Wei, one of his most prominent students.\nAnd he taught a lot of, he was the teacher in the abbot of a monastery, but he also taught a lot of lay people.\nAnd a lot of that teaching happened through letters.\nOnce you have achieved perfect stillness of body and mind.\nWe talk a lot about stillness in Zen.\nAnd there are different ways to understand and experience this stillness.\nYasutani Roshi talked about there being five different kinds of Zen.\nIn a sense, he was talking about five different aspirations for practicing Zen.\nHe said the first had nothing to do really with religious practice.\nIt was just wanting to improve our mental health, our sort of our general sense of well-being.\nAnd so using Zazen is just a form of meditation to do that, to quiet the mind.\nAnd through that, to get in touch with ourself a bit and just sort of calm down.\nHe said the second kind was a kind of Zen that was outside of Buddhism.\nIn other words, it had religious content in that it was a way of practicing that was part of a process of self-inquiry.\nBut it had nothing to do with Buddhist teachings.\nSo yogic meditation or practice, Christian contemplation, all these would be part of this kind of Zen.\nHe said there was another kind that was concerned with the experience of emptiness.\nWith the experience of stillness of body and mind.\nA complete stillness.\nA thorough, utter kind of stopping.\nBut that's all.\nIt's just really about that.\nThis is the kind of practice that we associate with the Theravadan school,\nwhere that realization of the emptiness of all things is what the focal point is.\nAnd he said there, then, is a kind of Zen that has to do with awakening to our true nature.\nSpecifically meaning realizing that Zazen is a process of actualizing that true nature.\nThat realizing the self is empty is, from this way of seeing things, incomplete.\nAnd then finally, the fifth rank of Master Tozan, to realize that the process and the goal\nhave always been the same thing, are inherently unified.\nSo when we talk about stillness,\nin a sense we have to get clear on what we mean by that.\nOnce you have achieved perfect stillness of body and mind.\nIs he just talking about quieting down?\nBeing able to get to ten?\nOr is he talking about something else?\nHe says, don't immediately settle down in this peaceful stillness.\nIn the teachings, this is called the deep pit of liberation.\nOne of the interesting things, you know,\nDardash has said on several occasions how we have to remember,\nwe have to always remember that the teachings that we read and hear about\nalways occurred within a very specific point in time.\nAnd that the teacher was always, you know, it wasn't a general teaching.\nIt wasn't for general consumption.\nIt was very specific.\nThat teacher was talking to a selected group of people that were sitting in front of them.\nOr on the other end of a letter, in this case.\nAnd it was the teacher's understanding of that group of people or that person\nthat determined what the teaching was.\nAnd so when we take those teachings out of context and put them in a book\nand separate them by hundreds or a thousand years and cultures and time and space,\nit's very easy to read them in a general way.\nAnd with that issue is mentioned that we have to understand that a lot of these teachings\nwere being geared towards people, monks and nuns,\nwho were in monastic training and were stuck in the experience of emptiness.\nBecause the danger of not understanding that is that we can read something like this\nand think that the message is basically, you know, drop that experience of stillness.\nThat that's not what it's about.\nIt's about being free and independent within the day-to-day functioning of our life.\nThat it's about being active, which is, of course, true.\nBut, you know, if we really read this, he says,\nonce you have achieved peaceful stillness.\nSo he's talking to somebody who's already experienced an essential dropping away of body and mind.\nSo he's not saying it's not important.\nHe's simply saying once you have experienced that,\nthen you must really make effort to not settle down there,\nto not get caught in that.\nAnd that's really critical because without that experience, really,\nthere is no Buddhist practice.\nThat's what practice is all about.\nThat's, in a sense, where it really begins.\nWhen we say that the questions,\nand that our questions and our answers come from the same place,\nthe question is, where is that place?\nWe say deep within each one of us, but where?\nWhere within each one of us?\nWhere is that wisdom seed that we're tapping into?\nWell, it comes out of this experience of stillness,\nof the falling away of body and mind.\nAnd it's kind of interesting because\nnot only is that where the answers,\nbut that's where we resolve our questions.\nBut that's where the questions come from, too.\nAnd one of the aspects of practice is that in the beginning,\none of the reasons that our reasons for practicing can be so confused or so obscured\nis because our mind is obscured and confused.\nSo many of us enter into practice just responding.\nI mean, every time we have guardian council meetings with people applying to be students,\nwe're reminded of this,\nyou know, how difficult it is to really be able to get in touch with,\nto feel,\nto be able to articulate why we're doing this thing.\nBut once we've really gone deep to that place,\nto that peaceful stillness,\nthe questions become very, very clear.\nBecause there's nothing in the way.\nThere's no obstruction.\nSo as the mind becomes attuned or unified,\nthe depth,\nour ability to really inquire,\nto probe,\nto examine,\ntakes on a whole different kind of potential.\nAnd that's why when,\nsometimes when we begin\na koan practice,\nlike the question,\nwhat is moved?\nA lot of times the first question is,\nwhat the hell does that mean?\nI mean,\nI don't even understand what the question is.\nSo how do I work with this question\nwhen I've got a question about the question?\nI don't even know where to start.\nWell,\nthat's part of the beauty of Mu,\nis that it's fresh,\nit's clean,\nit has no history.\nAs opposed to sitting with something like,\nwhat is truth?\nYou know,\nwe bring dictionaries and encyclopedias\nencyclopedias of meaning about that\ninto our city.\nBut Mu is just what?\nBut as we practice\nand through the practice of Mu\nget into that place\nof no mind,\nof no thinking,\nof thinking no thought,\nwhat Mu is becomes abundantly apparent.\nWhat the question,\nwhat is Mu is,\nbecomes very clear.\nSo it's for this reason\nthat we can't,\nwe can't practice koans\nwithout,\nwith an agitated mind.\nBecause we can't even get to the question.\nOr if we do,\nit's just a kind of intellectual thing.\nSo that stillness of mind\nis not just critical\nto the penetration\nof that koan,\nbut to the koan itself,\nto the questioning itself.\nWhich of course makes sense\nbecause the whole thing\nis about intimacy.\nAnd that's why\na lot of times\nthe experience\nor the feeling\nis that,\nyou know,\nto really\nenter on the path\nto really\nmove along,\nit gets worse\nbefore it gets better.\nBecause what we're doing\nis we're getting\ncloser and closer\nto the real heart\nof the problem.\nSo this is why\nit's so important\nto really investigate\nour own practice,\nparticularly in Zazen.\nYou know,\nare we just sitting\non the surface?\nAre we going deep\nwithin ourself?\nAre we,\nyou know,\nthere are a hundred thousand ways\nto back away\nfrom that\nstill point.\nyou know,\nover the years\nI've seen it\nagain and again.\nSometimes,\nyou know,\nsitting with people\nregularly,\nsuddenly,\nyou know,\nI started to become\naware that\nevery single period\nof Zazen\nthis person\ncalls,\nclears their throat.\nYou know,\nand usually\nwhen I begin\nto really see\nthat it's a pattern,\nI'll go up to them\nand say,\ndo you know\nthat you're doing this?\nMost of the time\nthey're completely\nunaware that it's happening.\nBut what that means\nis every single period\nof Zazen,\nthere's that backing away.\nSo it's really a matter\nof dropping in,\ndropping down,\nand seeing the ways\nfrom which we\nprevent ourself\nfrom doing that.\nYou know,\nthat's one of the\nvital aspects\nof just sitting\nin one place.\nOf being able\nto stay\nin one place.\nBoth within\na single moment\nin time\nand also\nover time.\nYou know,\nthat's why\nthis practice\nreally only works\nif we carry it\nthrough over time.\nBecause through\nthat process\nthere's a natural\nmaturation,\njust like there is\nwith anything.\nAny relationship,\nany discipline,\nany endeavor.\nYou know,\nwe don't really\nbegin to\nto see\nwhat it has\nto offer,\nwhat the potential\nis,\nuntil we've just\nbeen there a while.\nThat desire\nto really\nthrow away,\nto let drop\nthat agitated,\nconstantly moving mind,\nand it takes\nsome sincerity.\nIt takes\nsome real\ndesire\nto do that.\nYou know,\nwe have to\nwant to do\nthat.\nWhich basically\njust comes down\nto really\ntrusting\nthat.\nTrusting\nthat process.\nTrusting\nourself.\nAnd then\nwhat?\nAs\nDawe said,\nthen\nwe have\nto increase\nour effort\neven more.\nWe have\nto turn\nfreely\nlike a gourd\nfloating on\nthe water,\nindependent\nand free.\nNot subject\nto restraints.\nEntering\npurity\nand impurity\nwithout\nobstruction.\nIf we\ncan only\ncradle\nthe\nun-crying\nchild,\nwhat's\nthe use?\nIndeed.\nIn the\nLankavatara\nSutra,\nthe Buddha\nsaid the\nsame thing\nthis way.\nHe said,\nhaving attained\nthis exalted\nand blissful\ncondition\nof self-realization\nis realized\nby the\nSaravikas,\nwhich are\npeople who\nhave pursued\nthis\nexperience\nof emptiness,\nof dropping\naway\nbody and\nmind.\nHe says,\nbodhisattvas\nmay not\nenjoy\nby themselves\nthe bliss\nof cessation,\nthe bliss\nof samadhi,\nbut should\nthink\ncompassionately\nof other\nbeings and\nkeep\never fresh\ntheir\noriginal\nvows.\nThat is,\nthe vows\nto save\nall sentient\nbeings.\nso he's\nsaying,\nhaving\nrealized\nthis\nstill\npoint,\nthis\nstillness\nof body\nand mind,\nyou can't\njust sit\nthere and\nenjoy it.\nYou have\nto remember\nthere's a\nworld out\nthere.\nThere's a\ncrying child\nin addition\nto the\none that's\nnot\ncrying.\nThe way\nDaudishy\nsays it,\nif that's\nall we\ndo is\nenter into\nthat\nemptiness,\nwhat the\nhell good\nis it\nif it's\nnot\nfunctioning,\nif it's\nnot a\npart of\nour\nlife?\nSo how\ndo we\ndo this\nearnest\neffort?\nIn\nanother\nletter,\nThawai\nsays,\nI see\nthat you're\nunremitting\nin your\nconduct,\nthat you're\nnot carried\naway by\nthe press\nof your\nofficial\nduties,\nthat in\nthe midst\nof swift\nflowing\nstreams,\nyou vigorously\nexamine\nyourself.\nFar from\nbeing\nlax,\nyour\naspiration\nto the\npath\ngrows\never\nmore\nfirm\nas\ntime\ngoes\non.\nThat's\nwhat it's\nabout.\nIn\nthe midst\nof swift\nflowing\nstreams,\nyou vigorously\nexamine\nyourself.\nThat's\nwhy it's\nso important.\nThat's\nwhy it's\nso essential\nto be\nable to\ndo that\nexamination\nwith\nnothing,\nwith no\nstimulation.\ncoming out\nof that\nplace of\nstillness,\nbecause if\nwe can't\ndo it\nthere,\nwe sure\nas hell\naren't\ngoing to\nbe able\nto do\nit when\nwe're\nin the\nmiddle\nof a\ntornado.\nThings\nare\nhappening\ntoo\nquickly.\nThe\nmind\nis\nmoving\ntoo\nfast.\nWe\ncan't\nsee\nit.\nWe\nget\nlost.\nThat's\nwhy we\npress on\nall the\ndetails\nof\ntraining.\nThat's\nwhat\ntraining\nis.\nThat's\nwhy we\ntake\nsomething\nvery\nordinary\nlike\neating\na\nmeal\nand\nsay\ndon't\nmiss\na\nsingle\nthing.\nNotice\nhow you\npick up\nthe\nspoon.\nNotice\nhow you\nput it\ndown.\nNotice\nhow you\nlay out\nthe\nclaw.\nBecause\nif we\ncan't\ndo\nthat,\nthen we\nwon't\nbe able\nto do\nit\nin an\nordinary\nsituation.\nso we\ntrain in\na very\nsort of\nspecialized\nenvironment\nthat leads\nup to\na\ncompletely\nfree,\nuncontrolled\nsituation.\nIt's\nkind of\ninteresting\nthough.\nIf\nself-nature,\nif our\ntrue nature\nis empty,\nthen why\nisn't\nseeing that\nenough?\nWhy\nis it\nessential\nto go\nfurther?\nIf in\nseeing that\nself-nature,\nwe're seeing\nthe nature\nof all\nthings,\nof all\nphenomena,\nwhat's the\nproblem?\nWhy isn't\nthat enough?\nAgain,\nthe Buddha\nin the\nLankavatara\nSutra\nsays,\nthose\nattaching\nto this\nstillness,\nthose having\nexperienced\nit while\nentering\nupon a\nstate of\nsamadhi,\nare not\naware of\nthe workings\nof the\nsubtle\nhabit\nenergy\nwithin\nthemselves.\nFor\nthey think\nthat they\nwould enter\nupon this\nstate of\nsamadhi by\nextinguishing\nthe\nvijjnanas,\nwhich are\nthe\nfaculties\nthat\nperceive\nthings.\nSo there's\nan eye\nvijjnana,\nwhich\nperceives\nobjects,\nnose,\near,\ntaste,\nand so\non.\nHe says,\nbut in\nfact,\nthey're in\nthis state\nwithout\nextinguishing\nthese\nsense\nfaculties,\nwhich still\nsubsist\nbecause the\nseeds of\nthe habit\nenergy have\nnot been\nextinguished.\nAnd what\nthey imagine\nto be an\nextinction is\nreally simply\nthe non-functioning\nof the\nexternal world\nto which\nthey're no\nmore attached,\nno longer\nattached.\nthat's\nwhy it's\nso important\nbecause to\nsimply\nexperience\nthat self\nnature,\nthat empty\nnature,\nwe think\nwe've\nextinguished\nthe seeds\nof delusion.\nBut what\nhe's calling\nthe habit\nenergy is\nthe\nconditioning,\nis that\nreflex that\nwe have\nto respond\nto a\ngiven\nsituation\nthe way\nwe've\nresponded\nto it\nevery\nsingle\ntime\nit's\ncome\nup\nin\nour\nlife.\nSo\nhaving\nrealized\nthat\ninherent\nnature,\nthe\nemptiness\nof all\nthings,\nis still\nnot\nhaving\nextinguished\nor\nclarified\nor\npenetrated\nthat\nconditioning.\nHe says\nall that's\nreally\nhappening\nis that\nthe\nexternal\nworld\nis not\nfunctioning.\nAnd that's\nwhy we have\nto continue\nat that\npoint.\nIt's like\na\nsurgeon\nspending\nyears and\nyears to\nlearn how\nto be a\nsurgeon.\nAnd once\nthey've\nreally acquired\nthe skills,\nit's like\ndropping it,\nnot using\nit,\nnot operating,\nnot helping\nanybody.\nIt's\nkind of\ninteresting\nbecause when\nwe begin\npractice,\nyou know,\na lot of\ntimes I\nthink our\nexperience is\nthat things\naren't\nfunctioning.\nThe\nexternal\nworld is\nnot\nworking.\nWhat the\nBuddha is\nsaying here\nis that\neven after\nwe\npenetrate\nthat\nillusion\nof the\nself,\nit's\nstill\nnot\nworking\nbut in\na\ndifferent\nway.\nIt's\nnot\nworking\nbecause\nwe're\nattached\nto that\nnon-functioning.\nWe're\nattached\nto that\nstillness,\nto that\npeaceful\nstillness.\nAnd this\nhas been\none of the,\nthrough history,\nthis has been\none of the\nmain arguments\nor criticisms\nabout much\nof Zen,\nZen\nstudents,\nis that\nattachment\nto quiet,\nto stillness.\nBut the\nfact that\nwith a\nlittle bit\nof insight\nthat we\nstill haven't\nreally taken\ncare of the\nconditioning\nis what\ncauses a\nlot of\nconfusion.\nHow often\npeople have\ncome to me\nand said,\nyou know,\nhow is it\nthat so-and-so\nhas penetrated\nmoors,\nworking on\nkoans,\nand yet\nstill,\nyou know,\nthey're who\nthey are.\nThey still\nmake mistakes.\nThey still\nlike,\nyou know,\nsometimes\nare sloppy\nor,\nyou know,\nwhatever.\nwe ask\nthe same\nthings about,\nyou know,\npeople who\nare much\nfurther along.\nWe ask\nthe same\nthing of\nteachers.\nYou know,\nwhy aren't\nthey perfect\nyet?\nYou know,\nand of\ncourse,\nthe real\nquestion is,\nwhat does\nthat mean\nabout me?\nAnd that's\nusually what\nI say.\nIt's usually\nwhat I say\nis,\nhow's your\npractice\ngoing?\nHow's\nyour practice\ngoing?\nAnd sometimes\nit's that,\nyou know,\nlike in the\ncase of a\nteacher,\nsometimes\nwhat they're\nseeing is\nthe teacher\nusing delusion\nas the\nmedicine\nfor curing\ndelusion.\nBut sometimes\nwhat they're\nseeing as\nwell is\nthat the\nseeds of\nthat\nconditioning\njust simply\nhave not\nbeen\nextinguished.\nStill\npresent.\nSo when\nwill they\nbe\nextinguished?\nWhen will\nwe be\nperfect?\nThawei\nsays,\nworldly\npassions are\nlike a\nblazing\nfire.\nWhen\nwill they\never\nend?\nKaizan\nZenji\nsaid,\nthough\nthere\nbe\nthe\npurity\nof\nthe\nautumn\nwaters\nextending\nto\nthe\nhorizon,\nthat is,\nthough\nthere\nbe\nthat\npeaceful\nstillness\nreaching\neverywhere,\nhow does\nthat compare\nwith the\nhaziness\nof a\nspring\nnight's\nmoon?\nMost\npeople\nwant\nclear\npurity,\nno\ndefilement,\nno\ndistraction,\nno\nobstruction,\nno\nproblems.\nBut\nthough you\nsweep\nand sweep,\nthe mind\nis not\nyet\nemptied.\nThe\nseeds\nof that\nwhat the\nBuddha\ncalls habit\nenergy\nis not\nyet\ncleared\naway.\nWell,\nThawei\nwas one\nof the\nmost\ndeeply\nrealized\nand\nimportant\nteachers\nat one\nof the\nmost\nimportant\ntimes\nof\nZen.\nKezan\nZenji,\na very\nimportant\nfigure\nin\nZen,\ndeeply\nrealized,\nboth of\nthem\nteaching\nthis\nwhen\nthey\nwere\nvery\nmature.\nSo\nif\nthey\nare\nstill\nhaving\nto deal\nwith it,\nthen\nwhat's\ngoing\non?\nWhat's\nthe\nuse?\nWhy\nbother?\nIf\nno\nmatter\nhow\nmuch\nwe\nsweep\nand\nsweep,\nno\nmatter\nhow\nmuch\nwe\npractice,\nno\nmatter\nhow\nmany\ntimes\nwe\nlet\ngo,\nif\nthe\nmind\nis\nconstantly\ngoing\nto need\nto be\nswept,\nthen\nwhy\ndo it?\nIf\nwe're\nnot\ngoing\nto\nget\nto\nthat\nplace\nwhere\nwe\nno\nlonger\nhave\nto\npractice,\nwhere\nwe\nstill\nhave\nto\ndeal\nwith\nour\nown\nconditioning,\nwith\nour\ndelusion,\nthen\nwhy\ndo\nit?\nI\nmean,\nwe're\ngreeted\nat\nthe\ndoor\nwith\nthese\nfacts.\nI\nmean,\nthe\nbodhisattva\nvows tell\nit to\nus.\nThey\nsay,\nyou'll\nnever\ndo\nit.\nDesires\nare\ninexhaustible.\nYou\nwill\nnever\nput\nan\nend\nto\nthem.\nBut\nit\nalso\nsays,\nwe'll\nvow\nto\ndo\nthat.\nWe'll\nvow\nto\nput\nan\nend\nto\nthem.\nWell,\nthat\nargument\nabout\nwhy\ndo\nit\nis\nreally\nkind\nof\nnonsense.\nYou\nknow,\nit's\nlike a\nparent\nsaying,\nyou\nknow,\nno\nmatter\nwhat\nI\ndo,\nno\nmatter\nhow\nmuch\nI\ngive\nmyself\nto\nthe\nraising\nof\nmy\nchild,\nthey're\nstill\ngoing\nto\nhave\nproblems.\nAnd\nI'm\ngoing\nto\nbe\na\npart\nof\nthose\nproblems.\nBut\nnobody\nthinks,\nwell,\nthen I'll\njust\nbag it.\nIt's\nno point\nin trying.\nOf\ncourse\nnot.\nThere's\nanything\nthat's\nimportant\nto us\nthat we\nreally\nwant to\ngive\nour\nlife\nto.\npresent\nin that\nfirst\nmoment\nof having\nentered\ninto that\nparticular\narea\nis the\nfact\nthat we'll\nnever\ncomplete it,\nwe'll\nnever\nfinish.\nBut that\ndoesn't\nstop us.\nSo,\nyou know,\nthese vows\nare not\njust about,\nnot just\ncapturing the\nspirit and the\nreality\nof the\nBuddha Dharma,\nbut they're\nexpressing the\nreality of\nlife.\nYou know,\nit's just a\nmatter of us,\nwe usually\ndon't look at\nit quite so\ndirectly.\nYou know,\nand really,\nwhen you see\nsomeone who's\nmastered\nsomething,\nit's because\nwhat they're\nstudying and\npursuing is\nunattainable,\nand they've\ndedicated\nthemselves to\nit wholeheartedly.\nIt makes\nthem a\nmaster.\nIt always\nsays,\nright in the\nmidst of the\nhubbub,\nyou mustn't\nforget the\nbusiness of\nthe bamboo\nchair and\nthe reed\ncushion.\nthat means\nthe\nzafu,\nthe\nzabata.\nUsually,\nto\nmeditate,\nyou set\nyour mind\non a\nstill\nconcentration\npoint,\nbut you\nmust be\nable to\nuse it\nright in\nthe midst\nof the\ncommotion.\nIf you\nhave no\nstrength\nthere,\nafter all,\nit's as if\nyou never\nmade any\neffort in\nstillness\nat all.\nIf you\nconsider\nquietude\nright and\ncommotion\nwrong,\nthen this\nis seeking\nthe real\naspect by\ndestroying\nthe worldly,\nseeking\nnirvana,\nthe piece\nof extinction,\napart from\nbirth and\ndeath.\nWhen you\nlike the\nquiet and\nhate the\nhubbub,\nthis is\njust the\ntime to\napply effort.\nSuddenly,\nwhen in the\nmidst of all\nof that\ncraziness,\nyou topple\nthe scene\nof quietude,\nthat power\nsurpasses\nthe meditation\nseat and\ncushion by\na million,\nbillion times.\nin a sense,\nthis is all\nthat our\npractice is,\nis first\ngiving us\na container,\na way,\nto enter\ninto this\nstillness,\nwhich is\nsimply our\nself.\nClean,\nnaked,\nfresh.\nAnd then,\nit presents\nus with the\ncommotion,\nwith the\nchaos,\nwith the\nconfusion.\nwhether we're\ntraining here\nor whether\nwe're training\nsomewhere else.\nIt's the\nsame chaos,\nit's the\nsame commotion,\nit's the\nsame practice.\nIn a sense,\nthat's all\nwe're doing\nwith our\ntraining,\nour programs.\nThis weekend\nwe do\nhaiku\nand shakuhachi.\nIn a sense,\nthat's a\npart,\nan element\nof that\nis creating,\nintroducing\ncomplications.\nAnd\nDawei is\nsaying,\nin the\nmidst of\nthat,\nin the\nmoment,\nwhere it's\nall spiraling\nout of\ncontrol,\ndon't forget.\ndon't forget\nyour cushion.\nAnd what\nhe means\nis,\ndon't forget\nwhat zazen\nis,\ndon't forget\npractice.\nDon't forget\nthe business\nof your\ncushion.\nDon't forget\nthe work\nthat you\ndo there,\ndon't forget\nwhat that's\nreally all\nabout,\nwhich is\nthat very\nmoment\nthat's\nspiraling.\ninto\ncraziness.\nAnd this,\nto me,\nseems in\nmany ways\nthe key\nthing,\nnot forgetting.\nI was\nthinking about\nthis last\nseshin.\nI mean,\nyou know,\nseshin is\na situation\nwhere every\nsingle thing\nthat happens\nis deliberately\ndesigned\nto,\nin a sense,\nhelp us\nto remember,\nto practice,\nand to\nget us\nto practice.\nAnd I\ndon't know\nhow many\ntimes during\nthe course\nof the week,\nduring\nan interview,\nbasically what\nI was saying\nis,\nremember\nzazen?\nRemember\ncounting the\nbreath?\nYou know,\none person\nis working\non a book.\nthat they've\nbeen stuck\nwith for\na few\nyears.\nSuddenly,\nthey have\na creative\nimpulse.\nEverything\nbecomes clear.\nThe chapters\njust roll\nout.\nAnd that's\ntheir practice\nof seshin.\nSomebody\nelse is\ntaking,\nyou know,\ncounting the\nbreath,\nand is suddenly\ndrawing pictures\nin the sky,\nnumbers in\nthe sand.\nYou know,\nthere's a little\nMGM\nproduction.\nJust remembering\nto practice.\nnot forgetting\nthe business\nof the cushion.\nAnd that's\nreally it.\nTo remember\nin the midst\nof the\ncommotion.\nAnd having\nthe strength,\nhaving the\nresource\nof that\nstillness.\ncraziness.\nBecause if we\ndon't,\nthen what\nhappens in\nthat moment\nof craziness\nis,\nwell,\nwe do the\nbest we\ncan.\nBut when\nwe've\nexperienced\nthat,\nthen the\nwisdom\nthat comes\ndirectly out\nof that\nis\npresent,\nis applicable.\nand the\nwhole question\nof what's\nthe relevance\nbetween one\nthing and\nanother.\nYou know,\nwhat's the,\nhow do you\nintegrate\nthat stillness\nand the\nfunctioning?\nIt's\nclear,\nit's abundant.\nit doesn't\nalways mean\nwe can\ndo it.\nBut what\nneeds to be\ndone is\nobvious.\nSometimes\nwe may\njust not\nchoose to.\nAnd sometimes\nmaybe that\nconditioning is\njust a\nlittle bit\nstronger.\nbut there's\nthe,\nthere's the\nreal clear\nsense of\nwhat practice\nis in that\nmoment.\nSo\nremembering\nsimply to\npractice,\nremembering\nthat life\nis swiftly\npassing by.\nThis is\nthe Bodhi\nMind being\nraised again\nand again\nand again.\nI mean,\nwhen does\nour practice\nwhen do\nwe become\nlost?\nWhen do\nwe become\nestranged\nfrom it?\nWhen that\nBodhi Mind\nhas become\nlost and\nestranged.\nRemembering\nthat everything\nwe do\naffects everyone\naround us.\nRemembering\nnot to put\nit off\nuntil it's\ntoo late.\nI was\ntalking to\nmy father\nrecently\nwho was\ngot cancer\nand is\ndealing\nwith a\nterminal\nillness\nand he's\nnever really\nbeen involved\nin any\nkind of\nspiritual\npractice\nand he\nsaid,\nyou know,\nif I was\nyoung again\nI think\nI would\nlike to\npractice\nthen.\nI said,\nit has\nnothing to\ndo with\nbeing young\nor old.\nI said,\nthis is the\nperfect time.\nIn fact,\nwhat I said\nwas you\ncouldn't have\ndone it\nbefore.\nI don't\nthink you\nweren't\nready.\nYou're\nready now.\nRemembering\nthat vow\nto attain\nit.\nAs we\nconstantly\nbump into\nthe reality\nthat it's\nunattainable,\nvowing to\nattain it.\nThough there\nbe the purity\nof the autumn\nwaters\nextending to\nthe horizon.\nThat's our\ntrue nature.\nThat's the\nnature of\neach one\nof us.\nWhen it's\njust the\npurity of\nthe autumn\nwaters,\nit's not\nyet\nrealized\nits potential.\nWe've\nnot yet\nrealized\nour\npotential.\nHow can\nit compare\nwith the\nhaziness\nof a\nspring\nnight's\nmoon?"
