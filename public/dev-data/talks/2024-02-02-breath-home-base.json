  "transcript": "The breath is patient. It does not insist that we notice it, and yet it is always available. To call it a home base is to say we can return to it after every errand the mind runs.\\n\\nDuring sitting, place the attention gently where the breath is vivid—nostrils, chest, or belly. Let the breath teach you its rhythm rather than forcing one. When thoughts arrive, as they will, note them kindly and escort attention back home.\\n\\nIn daily life we practice the same return. On a crowded bus, in a difficult meeting, or while washing dishes, feel the breath. The body will signal when we have drifted into tension. Each return is a vote for presence.\\n\\nOver time the breath becomes less of an object and more of a companion. It reminds us that calm is not the absence of motion but the willingness to meet motion with awareness."
