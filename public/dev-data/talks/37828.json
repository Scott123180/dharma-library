  "transcript": "Homage to Buddha, Dharma, Sangha treasures.\r\n\r\nHow auspicious, the beginning of spring.  \r\nHow auspicious, the one house of the ancestral teachings and lineage.  \r\nHow auspicious, the Buddha Dharma prevailing widely.  \r\nHow auspicious, the temple gate prospers.  \r\nHow auspicious, when many disciples assemble to meet themselves and to encounter the moment the world comes and honors our way.  \r\nHow auspicious, how auspicious, how auspicious, the beginning of spring.  \r\nHow auspicious, how auspicious, the founding of this temple, Karinji Fire Lotus.  \r\nHow auspicious.  \r\nI changed that last part. He wasn't predicting we were going to be here. Maybe so.\r\n\r\nWelcome to everyone. I wish I could talk to all of you and see what brought you here today, but obviously it's the Dharma on some level. And welcome. This is the beginning of what we call Ango, a 90-day intensive training period. This goes way back to the time of the Buddha, when there were the monsoon seasons and the rains would bring the level of water up. The monastics used to travel—it was primarily a monastic community—and they used to travel from sangha to sangha to learn new things, work with different teachers. So this is part of an ancient history, over 2,500 years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was a great time to work with the Buddha, because the Buddha and all the disciples would be in one place. That was rare, because nobody could travel anywhere. So we recreate, re-enact, if you will, these Ango training periods in the spring and the fall.\r\n\r\nWe've gone through this winter, and there's always—I don't know, there's something about this spring one. It's always like coming out of the dark days of winter and just in tune with the earth and what it's doing: this revitalization, this sprouting, this growing, this budding, this greening coming. You can see the small shoots pushing their way through.\r\n\r\nWhen they would gather, they would set up like a university. They would have tents and temporary housing and all stay in one place. The emphasis was on collective practice. I still think that's true, that our Angos are about collective practice.\r\n\r\nYou know, I was reading this thing about how do you clean potatoes? I love potatoes. I have a real affinity for potatoes. The best way to clean potatoes is to put them in a pot of water and just let the dirt fall off. But you put them all together so they bump around and hit each other, and that's how the dirt falls off. I thought that's kind of like sangha: we all get in a pot, all of us, these potatoes, and just bump around, and that's how we get kind of clean. It just falls off. Just begins to fall off.\r\n\r\nWhen we want to generate these virtues of ours—our ability to be patient, generous, loving and kind, and have a joyful effort in practice—we also have to know the other side. We have to see where we're not generous, where we're unkind, where we're impatient. That's how we learn patience. And what a better way to be in this pot. That's where we really can find out new things.\r\n\r\nMaezumi Roshi used to call it a rock tumbler. But I like the potatoes better. If you've ever had a rock tumbler, they all bump together and smooth out their hard edges.\r\n\r\nSo it was a great time to really develop mindfulness, alertness, concentration, embodiment—all towards being of benefit. To bring more goodwill and a loving heart into the world. That's what the practice was about: to end suffering. End suffering in ourselves and in others. These are all nice words, but the day-to-day doing that and remembering how we act with our speech and our body and our thought, that's the work of each one of us and our intentions and how we might want to live.\r\n\r\nI sent out a newsletter, if you got it, with a quote from Thich Nhat Hanh that I really appreciated. He says, \"When we say, 'I take refuge in the sangha'—that's community—it's not a statement, it's a practice.\" I really appreciated that. It's not a statement, it's a practice.\r\n\r\nRefuge—the word in Japanese is \"ki-e\"—to unreservedly throw yourself into something. Almost like when a child is on the stairs and you say, \"Jump! Jump!\" and there's just that trust—they just go into your arms. It's that kind of \"ki-e\": unreservedly throwing yourself into the Sangha treasure, the Buddha treasure, the Dharma treasure.\r\n\r\nBuddha was constantly offering specific teachings and ways of training and practicing so we could be revitalizing, actualizing who we are, and really making contact with our innate wisdom and compassion. That is who we are. And to keep the pointing towards the wisdom and the compassion.\r\n\r\nHe would say, \"More Dharma is more Dharma.\" And that's what we say: having more Dharma in your life is more Dharma. Yesterday I said, it's really delicious, the Dharma, but nobody can taste it for you. We each have to engage it on our own. He said, it is the antidote for confusion, overwhelm, anxiety, not creating more harm—this practicing.\r\n\r\nThe point of this season was to intensify practice. It's not like there's always practice going on, but this is to intensify. I always clarify, because people, when I say \"intensify,\" I feel everyone gets all tense, like, \"Wow, I'm already so much,\" and there's an element of panic. That's not intensifying. It's to deepen. It's to focus our concentration, our contact with the Dharma.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons why we need to get the mind into concentration is so our sensitivity to what causes suffering can be seen more clearly, can be made bright. This is needed now and always.\r\n\r\nIf we're going to practice, step on the path for each of us to know, just have a sense, like, why do this? Why sit down on a cushion for 25 minutes or 30 minutes here in your home and just look, be still? Why? When you get just a sense of that—and it doesn't have to be a sentence or something linear or an idea, but just a feeling for that, why that might be helpful and actually see and experience why—it'll keep strengthening your practice and your wanting to encounter the Dharma, the teachings.\r\n\r\nSo it is to deepen and also to look at what you're already doing. Where are these places to deepen? Sometimes it's just—I've heard people say, \"I'm not very nice. I'm not a kind person. I want to be kinder.\" And it's just taking that up, looking for those places that we can. That's deepening, that we can just make a little shift, which ripples like crazy when it's for good. That kind of goodwill, it has a tremendous effect, tremendous reverberation. We don't always see it, but we will feel it. And you'll see it felt by others. If that's what you're working towards, it'll be verified by the universe.\r\n\r\nSo it could be coming in to sit here during the week. Maybe you are close by, or you can get here and you come one morning or evening a month or a week or each day, and you just commit for 90 days. So you were each looking for—and even if you just walked in today and you had beginning instruction, that's enough. Maybe you're just going to try this at home. Set yourself up at home and sit down. That's the intensifying, that's turning towards the Dharma that's so needed.\r\n\r\nFind what qualities we each personally need to be developing, and then that comes into the pot. What qualities do we need to abandon? What can we let go of? What is not serving? What habits do we have that we feel like, \"Oh, that keeps taking me the other way, a direction I don't want to go in, that's painful.\" Maybe we can just intensify, learning how to release and go in a different direction.\r\n\r\nThis is part of what Buddha called the customs of the noble ones: to know what to develop and what to abandon. He calls it the customs of the noble ones, which is each of us. He says that we learn how to delight in abandoning whatever we have to abandon and to delight in developing whatever needs to be developed. Delightful, either way.\r\n\r\nWhen the Buddha was teaching his son Rahula, he said, \"Look at your actions before you act. Look at your intentions. If you think that what you're going to do or say or think is harmful, you've got to tell yourself, 'No, don't do that.' If you don't foresee any harm, then you can do it. If while you're doing it you see that some harm is happening that you didn't anticipate, you stop. Otherwise, you keep doing it. Then when you're done, you reflect on the long-term consequences of your actions. If you see that there was any unforeseen harm, then you resolve not to repeat that mistake again. If you don't see that there was any harm, then you can take joy in the fact that you're training your mind well and you haven't harmed anybody at all.\"\r\n\r\nSo this is very careful, tender, pointed work that we're doing with ourselves when we take this path of turning around, turning the light backwards. Of course, it's not easy to take a good look at our actions. When we actually can and take responsibility, we feel that delight. Even though it may hurt and it's hard to see, there's a measure of joy. It's like, \"Oh, there it is. There it is. I can do something with that.\" It's a great relief. And we learn how to trust ourselves. It's not our fault, but we're responsible.\r\n\r\nRemember, as you'll go along in the Buddhist teachings, that at the basis is emptiness. There's no fixed condition. Nothing is fixed. It's in a constant state of movement. We're in a constant state of change. I think we can see that all the time, how fast we can be in one state and it changes—luckily. Otherwise, why practice? If we're fixed, there's nothing to practice, we're stamped, we're fixed—but we're not. We're not fixed.\r\n\r\nSo we bring everything that troubles us, holds us back, obscures us, to the path—our pain, our lack of confidence, our, you know, when we do hurt someone, we take responsibility. We bring that to our path and we open it up. It's not to define us. It's how we learn and grow. What a teaching.\r\n\r\nI remember going off the path and creating some harm. I wasn't really very conscious. I thought I was, but I did make some mistakes. It took me a while to make sure I could trust myself first before I could open up further. I really had to get that trust back that I wasn't going to repeat, in the way I had, what I'd done. And that I can trust myself more and also draw back blame, because blame never works. You can't blame anyone. It changes. If we really begin to bring it to our path and understand the teachings and karma, then there's a possibility we really gain some wisdom through it. That's the important part.\r\n\r\nI didn't kill anyone—just to clarify—it wasn't that egregious, you know, but it was just one of those things we do to each other.\r\n\r\nEach Ango, we have a theme, and for this spring, it's mountain training—it's the Eight Gates of Zen. This is my original teacher's recasting of the Eightfold Path of the Buddha: right view, right understanding, right livelihood, right speech, and so on. He created these eight gates, which are:\r\n\r\n- Zazen  \r\n- The teacher-student relationship  \r\n- Liturgy  \r\n- Moral and ethical teachings  \r\n- Creative expression and the body, the miracle of aliveness in the body  \r\n- Dharma study, Buddhist studies  \r\n- Work, our right action in the world  \r\n\r\nHe said, their gates are where we enter. But he said, there are no gates. There's just this life. But we create these gates so we can enter and experience the richness of our life through a particular focus. As we go further into them, hopefully we'll see how they're all interrelated. Buddhist studies is body practice. The highest art practice is our moral and ethical life. That's an art of how to live well. That's the greatest art practice—that it's an art to work with our body, that right action is zazen—all of them interpenetrating.\r\n\r\nWe'll have what we call a chief disciple, who's a student that has reached a certain level of training. This year it'll be a monastic named Dayo. He's up at the monastery, and you might see him here during Ango. He's been here before, but he's kind of like the lead person, setting example to the sangha in the most humble way they can. It's said the shuso, when it's a monastic, is supposed to be the one that cleans the toilets at night and nobody knows about it. So we'll see if that's what he takes up. But it's kind of like this secret practice, like you don't see what they're doing. They're doing things, but they don't make a big fuss about it.\r\n\r\nThen at the end of the Ango, he'll do his first talk and challenge the sangha in what we call Dharma encounter: take up a koan from the tradition, and everyone gets to ask him questions about his understanding. It's called the hot seat.\r\n\r\nSo there'll be lots of offerings, plentitude of offerings here and at the monastery. You can weave in and out of here. Please, this is your place. You know, this is only here for us. Right? Some residents are here that I'm very grateful for, that are living their own work life and serving the sangha by keeping this place going. Many sangha members and students come. But it only exists for us to practice the Dharma. So it's yours. I hope you can come as much as you can. Like today—it's great if this was always this full.\r\n\r\nWe have a regular zazen schedule through the week, which you can come to now that you've had beginning instruction. We'll have an introduction to the Buddhist precepts in March, which I'll be doing. What are the moral and ethical teachings of a tradition that doesn't have, say, a God or something external that we look towards? How do we know what's right and wrong? How do we guide our lives? What are the precepts?\r\n\r\nWe're doing renewal of vows ceremonies, whether you've taken vows or not. It's called Fusatsu. A lot of liturgy—one of the most liturgical ceremonies in our tradition, quite beautiful—where we acknowledge our harmful karma and our good karma that was ever created by me since of old on account of our beginningless greed, anger, and delusion. We can learn how to be at one with it, which means that response-ability to what we create with our body, mouth, and thought. It's not like it goes away, but we can at least get closer and intimate with it and say the yes—like, \"Yes, this has happened,\" whether we've done it or it's happened to us. It's an acknowledgment. Yes. And we can be at one—atonement—with it.\r\n\r\nThose will be happening. I'll be showing two films that we created. One is called \"Watching the Rock Grow.\" Have you ever seen that? Watching a rock grow? If you stare at it long enough, you'll see it happen! But this is a film about Daido Roshi and how he formed the monastery in the early years. It's going to be kind of interesting to watch that again with you. You can see, like, this has been so many people and thousands and ancestors. This is our 45th anniversary as a monastery, 25 as a temple here on State Street. Just all the hands and eyes—you—that have contributed to making this place a place of practice. So I thought we'd watch that together and then have a discussion. It's on a Saturday from 2 to 4. A couple of us thought, that's a good time, like it doesn't take up your whole day, you're not eating dinner yet—come watch a film.\r\n\r\nThe other one will be the Mountains and Rivers Sutra, which combines visual images, natural sounds, music, and Daido merging his artistic expression with a spiritual expression with the Dharma. So it's an opera, so it's sung—the Mountains and Rivers Sutra. This was all based on people that came to the monastery. Someone was an opera singer, someone was a writer of operas, and so they created this opera of the Mountains and Rivers Sutra with Daido's visual things. We'll talk about art practice—whatever you would like to—about this aspect of artistic and spiritual expression coming together.\r\n\r\nI will do face-to-face teaching for students and those of you that are formal participants, whether or not you are a student, and whoever else I can see so we can meet. It's a meeting in private on your practice and that includes, of course, your life, but it's brought into the Dharma. As you're sitting and things are coming up or getting clearer, we can check in with one another. Sometimes we don't know, we feel so alone. Sangha helps with that, to be able to see some of the potholes and some of the ways that we move forward. That'll be offered.\r\n\r\nWe'll be doing a Born as the Earth, Touching the Earth retreat led by some of our Jukai folks. Dogen said, \"These mountains and rivers, these buildings, these sidewalks, belong to those who love them.\" He didn't say about the sidewalks and the buildings, he just said, \"These mountains and rivers,\" which means phenomena, \"belongs to those who love them.\" If we love something, we'll take care of it, he hoped.\r\n\r\nSo Daido would take us on these wilderness retreats so we can get close to the earth. We like to maintain that in this city, that it's not that there isn't a wildlife here. This trip will be called River to River, meeting the waterways that surround us as New York City dwellers. Actually, our water here comes from the reservoir right by the monastery, right down the pipeline. We'll do work together and body practice sessions, really trying to see how we live one undivided life through these areas, these aspects of ourselves, how that comes together as one undivided life.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha knew that practicing more intensely gives us greater opportunities. You feel it right away. I'd also like to talk more about liturgy, especially now in the world, and how liturgy can be so helpful with grounding, with overwhelm, with just giving voice to what's coursing through us and opening up to something larger, to the larger wisdom aspect. It's helpful.\r\n\r\nBuddha said, more opportunities to recognize the Buddha mind that is steady and continuous, regardless of fluctuations, regardless of conditions, because we don't know, we can't control those, but we can work with ourselves. That's always been so hard. But sometimes it's when those conditions are that way, we find something true in our integrity and we deepen there.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble, or hard work, but to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in our heart—calm, seeing, contemplating, having responding-ability.\" We're encouraged not to get lost in the congestion of mind, remembering that we have a path. It's called Marga, having a path. We want to keep exposing the unshakability of the awakened mind. We need each other, and we need to practice that because we forget. I forget. We have to forget. We have to remember, keep remembering what we have, who we are.\r\n\r\nIt says if we look after and care for our mind really well, then we're not the only one who benefits. The act of generosity and kindness is both to ourself and to others.\r\n\r\nThe Buddha uses the image of this story he gives of two acrobats. You might know this. There's one acrobat who's the teacher, and then there's an assistant who is a young girl. The teacher says to the assistant, \"Okay, if you get up on my shoulders, because they're acrobats, and we'll get on top of that bamboo pole, we should look after each other so that we can both come down safely.\" And she says, \"No, no, no, I disagree. That's not going to work at all. Each person should look after themself so that we can each be safe and come down safely.\"\r\n\r\nIt's kind of interesting, right? At first you're like, Oh, that sounds really selfish, you know? And I always thought that on the airplane too—you know, put your own mask on first and then go help people—because we're not... Obviously that's kind of not nice, you know, put it on them. But it's like, we can't be useful if that's going to help us help more. Then we balance ourselves first because we can't balance another person, can we? So we can't look after other people's balance. We have to look after our balance so that we don't knock somebody else off balance, is what he was teaching.\r\n\r\nHe says, \"When we're helping ourselves, we are helping others.\" Buddha said, \"Looking after oneself, one looks after others. Looking after others, one looks after oneself.\" Yeah. Takes courage. I have to summon courage.\r\n\r\nI was at Ayo Yetunde's retreat the week on microaggressions, on just basically being aggressive and how we've handled that in our lives and on this planet, in this particular country. She speaks about Indra's Net, this realization of how we are all interpenetrated and interconnected. Whatever we think, that our actions don't matter, but it does—it affects everyone everywhere. You know, they say when a butterfly flaps its wings in France, we feel the breeze here. I think this is bearing out all over.\r\n\r\nI wanted to read this inescapable mutual mutuality that's ever present. It's from Resmaa Menakem. He wrote \"My Grandmother's Hands,\" \"Quaking America,\" and \"Monsters in Love.\" And so she writes—Ayo articulates it so beautifully:\r\n\r\n\"We are conceived into the net, born into it, and exist within it. We will die in its entanglements. In the meantime, can we enhance the ways we live in this vast and abundant community of kin, near and far? Casting Indra's Nets calls us to live out of and into the best parts of who we are, because we are all kin. She urges us to return to our basic goodness and choose mutuality over brutality, time after time, moment after moment, breath upon breath. If you're ready to be part of this transmutation, please turn to practice.\"\r\n\r\nSo that's what we have in store for us, this Ango. I wanted to give us time to enter together. There's a formal entry, but I'm calling forth here just an entry into walking the path of peace, not creating harm, practicing good, and actualizing good for others that we can all do together. Not any kind of formal entry, just by your own yes. You can be able to offer incense today and also sign the scroll. We'll have a few more posted.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to bring in briefly just something Martin Luther King said about this net of mutuality, lest we forget. Let's bring him in:\r\n\r\n\"And don't forget, in doing something for others, that you have what you have because of others. Don't forget this. We are tied together in life and in the world. And you may think you got all you got by yourself, but you know, before you got out here to this temple this morning—you are dependent on more than half the world. You got up in the morning and you go to the bathroom. You reach over for a bar of soap, and that's handed to you by a Frenchman. You reach over for a sponge, and that's given to you by a Turkish person. You reach over for a towel, and that comes to your hands from the hands of a Pacific Islander. And then you go to the kitchen to get your breakfast. You reach over to get a little coffee, and that's poured in your cup by a South American. Maybe you decide that you want a little tea this morning, only to discover that that's poured in your cup by someone who's Chinese. Or maybe you want a little cocoa and that's poured to you by a West African. Then you want a little bread and you reach over to get it and that's given to your hands by an English-speaking farmer, not to mention the baker. Before you get through eating breakfast in the morning, you're dependent on more than half the world. That's the way he says God structured it. So let us be concerned about others because we are dependent on others.\"\r\n\r\nSo much wisdom that we can draw from. Let's point ourselves towards getting wisdom.\r\n\r\nTo close, we'll do this ceremony and we're going to be chanting what's called the Jizo Shingon Dharani. Jizo Bodhisattva is one of the principal bodhisattvas from the tradition—actually, I think you're all Jizo Bodhisattvas. Jizo Bodhisattva is... so they're not external, like they're us, they're qualities that we possess as a protector of those who are traveling, of women, children, all beings. They tend to go into hell realms and help people. So when your friend is in hell and you just are right there with them in presence, that's Jizo, Jizo Bodhisattva. Just these acts of guiding people and stepping in when you need to.\r\n\r\nSo this is a Dharani, a short calling up of those qualities. It's a repetition: \"Um ka ka Kabisa ma e soaka, um ka ka Kabisa ma e soaka...\" We'll just go.\r\n\r\nI looked at the number of people today and I thought, oh my gosh, if we're all making incense offerings, this is going to be a long service! So I thought students, formal students on behalf of the sangha can make this offering right now. Then we'll leave these haku boxes out and anyone else can make an offering as the service ends and before we go up for refreshments or at any time before you leave. What it is, is there's powdered incense and you just unite with it and you put a little on. The burning charcoal's on the left—so don't pick up the charcoal, that's not the incense. It's pretty clear. I'm saying that because some people have picked up the charcoal—I have!\r\n\r\nSo pick up the powdered incense and you make an offering there. You hold in mind your intensification, your dedication, your intention. It may not be formed, but just feel it, that'll carry it through.\r\n\r\nSo we'll get up, we'll hear a drum, and then we'll start the chanting and we'll go from there. Afterwards we'll have a chance to meet upstairs informally. Everyone can come up and have some refreshments, and there are some students you'll see. So feel welcome, if you're new, to meet people and talk to people about what's happening a little further.\r\n\r\nYeah, I'm just really glad you're here and that you came, and that we can form a community like this and support one another and know that this is here for you.\r\n\r\nThank you. Thank you for listening.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about the Zen Center of New York City's programs, retreats, and residency, please visit our website at zmm.org/zcnyc."
