Mountain Monastery.\nShugin is the head of the Mountains and Rivers Order and abbot of the monastery.\nThis talk, like all of our talks, is offered free of charge.\nIf you would like to make a

Master Huan Zhong of Mount Daochi said to the assembly,\nTo speak about 10 feet is not as good as to practice one foot.\nTo speak about one foot is not as good as to practice one inch.\nMaster Dongshan commented on this, saying,\nSpeak what cannot be practiced.\nPractice what cannot be spoken.\nThe commentary.\nYou should clearly see that it is not wrong to speak of 10 feet.\nIt's just that to practice one foot is far more important than speaking about 10 feet.\nBut we don't think, but do not think that either is lacking in virtue.\nIn each, the whole of ceaseless practice is present.\nTherefore, the true meaning of Master Dongshan's speak what cannot be practiced,\npractice what cannot be spoken,\nis that practice and speech thoroughly interpenetrate.\nActivity and expression are interdependent.\nThus, a full day of speaking is none other than a full day of practice.\nAnd a full day of practice is none other than a full day of speaking.\nThe verse.\nPractice without understanding is like eyes opened in the darkness.\nUnderstanding without practice is like eyes closed in the daylight.\nWhen practice and understanding have merged,\neyes are open in the bright light of day.\nI was thinking earlier in the week about this holiday season,\nthis time of year when there's so much speaking about peace and joy,\nlove and compassion, generosity.\nAnd in Buddhist practice, because it's a path based in practice,\nthat since the beginning, there's been an ever-present experience\nof the teachings expressing, speaking about the Dharma and then practicing the Dharma.\nAnd language is something we use all the time for all kinds of things.\nAnd so, you know, when we offer words, like even words on a store-bought card,\nthose words are expressing something.\nThey're expressing a sentiment that are felt to be true,\nthat are being offered to someone, even if you didn't write them.\nAnd that is the important thing.\nThey can, though, be mistaken, those words, for what they are pointing to.\nSo the words love and peace can be mistaken for love and peace itself.\nThis is why Buddhism, in particular, Zen, I think,\nhas such a deep relationship with language.\nBecause from the very beginning, the Buddha hesitated to teach,\nrecognizing the challenge of how to teach,\nwhich meant he would have to use language, he would have to speak,\nand yet how to do that in such a way that didn't take students further away from the Dharma,\nsince ultimately it goes beyond speech.\nAnd so there's a lot of emphasis on the power of language in Buddhism,\nin the precepts,\nthe caution around language in the Zen tradition.\nIt's a special transmission outside of words.\nNo reliance on the sutras.\nBut also recognizing that how powerful they are.\nThey can move, uplift, inspire.\nBut words themselves are not yet practiced.\nAnd because speaking, in many ways, is so much easier than practicing,\nand it's how we begin, usually,\nwe have to, it's worth examining.\nBecause words can, rather than uplift and inspire,\nthey can deaden us to the very thing that they're pointing to.\nI think particularly for Buddhist practitioners,\nwhere there is so much engagement of the teachings,\nand so much both in terms of just encountering them,\nreading them, studying them,\nbut also in terms of daily practice,\nchanting, uttering the vows, and so on.\nSo at what moment does speaking become practice?\nHow are they two?\nAnd how are they not two?\nSo Dara Roshi says you should realize that it's not wrong to speak of ten feet,\nit's just that to practice one foot is far more important.\nBut don't think that either is lacking in virtue.\nIn each, the whole of ceaseless practice.\nIt's present.\nAnd ceaseless practice is something that Master Dogen spoke a lot about.\nI brought up some of this in the Enlightenment vigil.\nDogen on ceaseless practice taught that\non the road of Buddha ancestors,\nthere's always unsurpassable practice.\nCeaseless and sustained.\nIt forms the circle of the way and is never cut off.\nBetween aspiration, practice, enlightenment, and nirvana,\nthere's not a moment's gap.\nContinuous practice is the circle.\nIt is undivided.\nIt cannot be forced.\nAnd so Dogen uses this, and Dara Roshi invokes this,\nto speak about speaking and practicing.\nDogen says,\nit may appear that Master Dachy was warning the people of his day not to ignore continuous practice\nand not to forget about mastering the Buddha way.\nSo that's easy to understand.\nIt's easy to understand this koan is saying,\nyou know, don't just talk about it,\npractice it.\nThere's more important to do a little bit of practice\nthan it is to talk a lot about practice.\nAnybody can understand that.\nDoesn't mean everybody's going to do it,\nbut it's easy enough to understand.\nBut then he goes on to say,\nhowever,\nDachy was not saying that speaking 10 feet is of no value,\nbut rather that the practice of one foot has greater power.\nThe comparison between speech and practice is not limited to one foot or 10 feet.\nIt's like Mount Sumeru and a poppy seed.\nSumeru reveals its entire size.\nA poppy seed reveals its entire size.\nThe great point of continuous practice is just like this.\nSo it's easy to understand that speaking about Zazen is not doing Zazen.\nThat speaking about compassion is not yet being compassion.\nBut Dogen is saying the comparison between them is like Mount Sumeru and a poppy seed.\nSo one can seem much greater.\nOne can seem smaller.\nSitting occasionally.\nSitting regularly.\nDoing Zazen.\nBecoming a student.\nBecoming a monastic.\nWe could look at those as different sizes, you might say, of practice.\nDifferent scales.\nBut what Dogen is saying is each reveals its entire size.\nAnd this is the nature of continuous practice.\nSo we chant, vast is the robe of liberation, a formless field of benefaction.\nI wear the Buddha's teaching, alleviating the suffering of all beings.\nWe could also think, I want to practice loving kindness.\nI would like to help others.\nI would like to be helpful to others.\nSo, which is the poppy seed?\nAnd which is Mount Sumeru?\nEach reveals its entire size.\nBut the karmic results are not the same.\nEven though the karmic results are themselves continuous practice and also reveal their entire size.\nAnd yet, they're not the same.\nAnd so, to speak words is powerful.\nTo practice them has greater power.\nThe karma will be different.\nBut their essential nature is the same.\nAnd this is why practicing the Dharma is so challenging.\nBecause our dualistic mind thinks in terms of that which we can measure.\nThat which we can hold up and compare.\nAnd so, to invoke, to establish aspiration, to make commitment, to take a vow, to practice.\nEach of these reveals its entire size.\nThey're not separate.\nBut they can create different results.\nCeaseless practice, as Dogen is speaking about it, as this Cohen is speaking about it,\nwas present before we even heard of Buddha Dharma.\nIn essence, it's not about Buddhism.\nIt doesn't increase or decrease.\nIt's not more present within a Buddhist than it is a Christian, someone who's Jewish, Muslim, or atheist.\nOr just doesn't care about any of that stuff.\nBut without practice, regardless of the path, it won't be realized.\nAnd without realization, it doesn't appear in the world.\nAnd because we can think while we're sleeping, we can chant while daydreaming, we can utter vows while being distracted,\nwe can sit on this diamond seat waiting for someone to save us,\nit is important to be diligent.\nBut it is important to apply ourselves.\nThat's why Dada Roshi says, practice without understanding is like eyes open in the darkness.\nSo Zazen doesn't exist by itself.\nSo to just do meditation, right, just as meditation, is not yet Zazen.\nIt's not Zazen of Buddha Dharma.\nIt's not that there's anything lacking in it, but it's like opening the eyes in darkness.\nThat's why the teachings are so important.\nAnd yet the teachings, if we just engage the teachings and we don't sit,\nthen that can be like we're developing understanding, but it's intellectual.\nAnd so that can be like opening our eyes, I mean, rather having our eyes closed in the daylight.\nSo we understand something, but we still bump into everybody.\nBecause we're not practicing.\nThat's why right understanding is the beginning of the Eightfold Path.\nWhen we're sitting, when we're practicing, do we understand what we're doing?\nNot in a way that it leads to measuring the poppy seed versus Mount Simmeru.\nIs this good or bad?\nBut in the sense of understanding how to practice.\nSo we don't just understand Zazen as a series of guidelines or rules or instructions.\nBut we're understanding it within this vast field of Dharma.\nWhen practice and understanding have merged, then our eyes are open in the bright light of day.\nSo when we speak, speaking is not saying words about practice.\nIt doesn't bring one closer to practice.\nIt is practice itself.\nThis is continuous practice that Dogen is speaking about.\nContinuous practice is not dependent on what you do.\nBut what you do has everything to do about continuous practice.\nWhen speaking reveals its entire size, then we realize that at the time of speaking, there is no road of practice.\nAt the time of practice, there is no path of speaking.\nWe see that all along we've been wearing Buddha clothes, eating Buddha food, living a Buddha's life.\nWhich is very, very different than we might understand that without practice.\nIn other words, it's intimacy.\nAnd so there is just forgetting to practice.\nRight?\nSo there's not speaking about it.\nThere's no awareness.\nThere's no practice.\nThere is not forgetting to practice.\nTo speak about 10 feet is not as good as practicing one foot.\nSo you practice one foot.\nYou practice one inch.\nAnd then there's forgetting.\nSpeaking and practice.\nWhen self and other.\nWhen thinking and non-thinking.\nWhen practice and not practicing.\nWhen path and liberation can't be found.\nYou know, in a way it's like, you know, we begin practicing and we're cut off, shut off, distant from so many aspects of our being.\nOur mind, our mind, our emotions, our past, our present, our body, the results of our actions.\nIt's all there.\nIt's like having the eyes closed in darkness.\nWe don't see it.\nWe see some.\nWe see aspects.\nIt's not utter darkness.\nOtherwise, we'd really be in trouble.\nBut, there's a lot of, a lot that's missing.\nAnd then as we begin practicing, we begin to open up, awaken, rediscover this complex, unified system that we are.\nThere's a whole universe, right?\nThe residents have been meeting recently and looking at male and female, masculine and feminine.\nAnd the ways in which, the ways in which we've been socialized cause a tremendous amount of pain and suffering.\nThat we inflict on each other, that we inflict on ourselves, that men in particular inflict on women as one group to another group.\nAnd that gaining access, rediscovering, finding our way into the vastness of our being.\nBecause what that conditioning does is create such a very narrow and tight and confined sense of self, of identity.\nThis is okay.\nThis is not okay.\nYou're this, but you're not that.\nAnd so to, to awaken means in that way, awakening to those various aspects.\nThe whole of one's being.\nBecause until that happens, there is, there are walls and boundaries.\nThere is conflict.\nThere is pain and suffering.\nThere's the perpetuation of all of that.\nThose things can't dissolve until we see them.\nAnd so in that, all, all that is, all that we are, becomes present, illuminated.\nAnd then there is the capacity, the ability to forget.\nTo forget that self, that identity, that sense of you, that sense of me.\nAnd that sense of you that I put on you.\nThat sense of me that you put on me.\nThat's why Bodhidharma said that letting go of the self is the greatest giving.\nNot just for oneself, but for others.\nBecause when we realize the self is empty, we realize the self of everything is empty.\nAnd so there has to first be remembering, bringing to life, integrating, gaining confidence,\nand a kind of naturalness within all of those aspects.\nAnd then there is the forgetting of that which you are.\nSo that you can appear without arriving, can speak without establishing,\ncan practice without knowing, can realize without accomplishing.\nSo here we can think of speaking as facing the person and practicing as facing the empty sky.\nEach is complete in their virtue.\nAnd since this is the essence of faith, in the Prajnaparamita Sutra, the Buddha said,\nwhat is having little faith?\nAnd then he answered, he said, having little faith is to have little faith in the teaching\nthat form is empty of form, that enlightenment is empty of enlightenment.\nThat feeling is empty of feeling.\nAnger is empty of anger.\nJoy is empty of joy.\nAnd thus, when we don't understand this, we struggle to stand firmly\nwithin non-abiding, non-abiding, joyful effort, patience, compassion, meditation, wisdom, the Padamitas.\nIn other words, we struggle to practice because we're trying to do so by standing firmly.\nWe're trying to practice the great release by holding on.\nDogen quotes another master who spoke on these, commented on Dongshan's words,\nspeak what can't be practiced, practice what can't be spoken.\nMaster Yunju said, at the time of speaking, there is no road of practice.\nAt the time of practice, there's no path of speaking.\nAnd then Dogen says, his words show that it's not that there is neither practicing nor speaking.\nAt the time of speaking, you don't leave the monastery for your entire life.\nAt the time of practicing, you wash the head and request Juefang to shave it.\nThis is referring to another koan.\nYou should not waste the time of speaking or the time of practicing.\nAnd I think this is the essence of the Buddha's teaching on idle talk.\nHe speaks of four ways that we speak that turn us against ourselves.\nTo speak divisively, to speak harshly, to speak falsely, and to speak idly.\nSo interesting.\nWhat does that mean, to speak idly?\nI think, in a sense, what Dogen is saying here, to waste the time of speaking.\nWe're speaking, but we're wasting the time of speaking.\nWe're practicing, but we're wasting the time of practice.\nHow do we do that?\nAnd what he's saying is, when you speak, let that be an eternity.\nWhen you practice, let that be the whole universe.\nHere, there is no possibility of wasting time.\nThe mind that divides, that separates.\nWhen I was down visiting my family last week, my brother brought down a book on ageism.\nAnd so that ended up being a big part of what we talked about during the week.\nAnd the author of this book said something so obvious and something that I'd never thought of before.\nShe said, you know, the ageism, the bias, the prejudice and discrimination against those who are older.\nShe said, is a group that everyone hopes to be a part of.\nRight?\nAnd yet, when you become a part of it, you know, the ageism is, it's a drag.\nAnd so, and then she says, then given that, that everybody wants to get older.\nAnd yet, when we're young, we have a lot of views towards those who are older.\nRight?\nWhich means we have a lot of views against ourselves.\nRight?\nAnd so what kind of madness is that?\nAnd then the whole question of, you know, how the mind divides.\nSo when exactly do we become old?\nLike, what's the line?\nRight?\nWhat is middle age?\nWhen does that happen?\nThat's why Dada Rishi says, practice and speech thoroughly interpenetrate.\nEverything that we would put on opposite sides of a wall thoroughly interpenetrate.\nThe wall is something that we construct for some purpose.\nWhat is that purpose?\nDogen says, on the great road of Buddha ancestors, there's always unsurpassable practice, ceaseless and sustained.\nIt forms a circle of the way and is never cut off.\nThis being so, it's not divided and it can't be forced.\nAnd so to even talk about speaking and practice is to create a division.\nSo why are these masters doing this?\nBecause until those walls are realized as false, as unreal, we live within them.\nWe establish them.\nWe find ourselves on one side or the other.\nAnd so we turn our attention to that which is illusory by its very nature that is causing suffering by our use of it so that we can understand.\nAlthough everything is undivided, nothing ultimately can be forced, the projections of our mind create a very different sense of things.\nThe circle is broken.\nThe road is cut off.\nThere are gaps between aspiration, practice, realization, and liberation.\nWe don't see the effects of our action.\nWe don't notice.\nDogen says, this means your practice affects the entire earth and the entire sky in every direction.\nAll things interpenetrate.\nAlthough this is not noticed by yourself and others, it's true.\nSo even though we don't notice it, we may not know that it is true.\nAnd that's really the essence of the Dharma.\nThe Dharma is teaching what is true, whether you notice it or not, whether you believe in it or not, whether you practice it or not, whether you're Buddhist or not.\nIt's like gravity.\nSo you can learn about gravity, read articles about gravity, or not.\nBut not reading or understanding gravity doesn't make gravity any less true or present.\nAnd it's kind of a good analogy because we're constantly experiencing and under the influence of gravity and navigating with it,\neven though we may have no understanding of it.\nI guess, even deny it.\nWe could deny that it's true.\nI imagine there are people who have denied that it's true.\nIt seems like you could just take them up into a tree and throw them off a limb.\nYou know, but even that, the evidence of that, we could, you know, we could deny.\nAnd so this is why faith is so important.\nBecause even though it's true, our practice affects the entire earth and the entire sky in all directions, we may not notice this indeed.\nThat's why it's so important to have faith and not get so stuck on our assessment, our constant assessing of the results of our practice.\nOn the one hand, we need to be able to reflect and be aware of what's happening in our practice so we can be continuing to develop it and make sure that we're practicing in accord to the Dharma.\nYou know, I mean, if we're practicing and things are never changing, you know, then maybe we need to reflect on that.\nWhy? What's happening?\nOn the other hand, we can be constantly reflecting, constantly assessing, constantly second-guessing.\nKense Rinpoche talks about four kinds of faith.\nHe said there's clear faith, which is just the natural experience of joy or delight when we encounter the Dharma for the first time.\nI remember feeling that.\nIt was like, for the first time, I felt like I was encountering the understanding that I didn't understand, but I was searching for.\nAnd that somebody seemed to know about, something about.\nAnd then there's longing faith, which is the desire then to experience that, that those teachings are pointed to.\nSo, so clear faith is sort of the natural, innocent response to something.\nIt's like meeting someone that you weren't even aware you'd ever met, and yet there's a sense of familiarity.\nAnd then there's the longing to get to know that person, right, to practice.\nAnd then there's confident faith, the faith that comes as we begin to experience practice, the truth of it.\nAnd then there's irreversible faith, where we get to the point where it's so integrated that it's no longer a question of,\nam I going to practice or not?\nIs this something that I am doing or not?\nDo I want to or not?\nIt's no longer outside.\nIt's just who you are.\nIt's just what your life is.\nAnd it doesn't mean it's always easy.\nBut that question of, is it inside or outside?\nIs it something that I say yes to or no to?\nHas dissolved because of the confidence of your own experience.\nAnd the realization in that confidence that it's no longer a question of practicing teachings,\nof engaging in a practice that the Buddha taught, that teachers teach, that happens in monasteries.\nBecause, in other words, it's what life is.\nThat's why Dogen speaks about continuous practice as being every moment for everyone and everything.\nWhen we begin practicing, then continuous practice begins to be an experience, a realized experience.\nThat's what gives rise to confident faith.\nAnd so, in that sense, we have been practicing our whole lives.\nWe have been within continuous practice our whole lives.\nPerhaps that's why, when those of us who have an affinity for the Dharma encounter it for the first time,\nthere's such a frequent sense of homecoming.\nFaith is always in a kind of dynamic with confidence.\nEven at the very beginning, when we don't know anything, we haven't practiced, we don't know what that is.\nWe've had no experience of the truth of this.\nBut even that faith has to have confidence in it, otherwise it's not faith.\nIf there were no confidence in that faith, it wouldn't be faith.\nRight?\nSo, even in those very initial sparks, there is some confidence.\nWell, what the hell is that about?\nWhere does that come from?\nHow can you know before knowing?\nUnless you already know.\nUnless that which the Dharma is pointing to, that which practice brings us to, is already there.\nIt has to be.\nAnd so, it's always in tension with, a kind of dynamic with what others have discovered.\nAnd so, we encounter the teachings of past masters.\nWith what seems true, but is not yet clear within ourselves.\nWith what is developing, as we begin practicing.\nAs we're practicing, what we begin to have, what we have more and more faith in, and trust in.\nAnd trust that it will be realized in time.\nAnd as we realize it, that faith and confidence continue to work in an incredible dynamic, a beautiful kind of dynamic.\nIn the sense that there is more.\nThat's why Dogen says, even if you might try to ignore it, in order to hide a crooked intention, and escape from it.\nThat very ignoring is also continuous practice.\nIn other words, you can't get away.\nGet away from what?\nAs long as it, the Dharma, self-nature, your original self, is something outside, it is still reversible.\nIt is something we can turn away and walk away from.\nHow can it become irreversible when you realize that's no longer possible?\nWhen you realize that even if you were to ignore it in order to hide, it's still there.\nTo go off here and there looking for continuous practice appears similar to the aspiration for it.\nBut it's like leaving behind the treasure at home.\nYou've left it behind.\nWandering through wind and water at the risk of your life, you shouldn't discard the treasure of your inheritance.\nWhile you were searching in this way, the Dharma treasure would appear to be absent.\nThis being so, it's best just not to let continuous practice slacken, even for a moment.\nI was reading an article that somebody sent me about mindfulness in the corporate world.\nAnd it was saying that at Aetna Insurance Agency, which they described as not exactly being a cutting-edge, progressive, out-there-on-a-limm institution,\nthey have, there's a guy whose company title is Chief Mindfulness Officer.\nCMO.\nHow about them apples, right?\nAnd so they were talking about, but of course, what does it all come down to?\nSo their mindfulness program is described as offering this.\nParticipants regain 62 minutes per week of productivity.\nThey are seeing an approximate dollar return in terms of productivity alone of more than $3,000 per person per year.\nThere is a bottom line.\nSo that's just what we do.\nRight?\nThat's what people do.\nThat's what our culture does.\nThat's not Buddhism.\nRight?\nThat's not mindfulness.\nAnd yet it is not absent.\nContinuous practice is not absent from it.\nBut the results of that are quite different than the results of mindfulness.\nAs an integral part, but a part of the whole of Buddha Dharma.\nShantideva says,\nWith joy, I celebrate the virtue that relieves all beings from the state of suffering.\nAnd from the sorrows of the states of loss and places those who languish in the realm of bliss.\nWith joy, I celebrate those virtues.\nI rejoice in the virtue that creates the causes, that creates the conditions, that makes it easier, more possible, of gaining the enlightened state and celebrate the freedom that's won by living beings from the cycles of pain.\nThat intention, that intention, that ocean of great good, Shantideva said, that seeks to place every being in a state of bliss, of liberation, and every action that is taken in that way, that is my delight and my joy.\nThat is my happiness.\nAnd through these actions now performed, practicing that, and by all the virtue I have amassed, right, by the karma that's created, may I offer that such that the pain of every living being be holy, scattered, and relieved.\nAnd those teachings, those words, so powerful, and practicing those are not too.\nAnd where that happens is within us.\nThat's why we meet every day and sit.\nThat's why we meet here every week and encounter the Dharma in Atesha.\nThat's why every day we do liturgy.\nThat's why all of this is here.\nTo realize what our lives already are.\nSo that when you see, you know, let there be peace and joy on a card.\nRight?\nThat was made in a lot of thousands or millions.\nBy someone who was or was not paying attention.\nAnd given by someone who may feel more or less strongly about that.\nThat when you see those words, you understand their meaning.\nThat the intention in which they were created and offered is not irrelevant.\nYou see that.\nBut it doesn't limit you.\nIt doesn't limit me.\nSince the beginning, the path has never been anywhere but here.\nToday, it is the ten directions.\nThere is only one gate to the great liberation.\nYet no, there is still another way.\nSo for those of you who won't be joining us for Rahatsu or for New Year's Eve, have a nice holiday.\nWhatever that means for you.\nWhich basically means,\nMay you be free of suffering.\nMay you be a benefit to the world.\nMay your life matter and you know it.\nMay others' lives matter and you know it.\nMay you come home.\nAnd may we come home together.\nMay you come home.\nMay you come home.\nMay your life matter and you know it.\nMay you come home.\nMay you come home.\nMay you come home.\nThanks so much for listening.\nThe Monastery's Quarterly Journal, Mountain Record, has a new home at
