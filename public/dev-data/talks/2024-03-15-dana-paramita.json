  "summary": "A gentle encouragement to let generosity become the tone of daily life rather than a special event.",
  "duration": "18:20",
  "location": "Mountain Gate Zendo",
  "transcript": "When we speak of dana, of generosity, we are not speaking only about envelopes or donations. We are speaking about a heart that cannot help but spill over. The Buddha described it as a freedom from the tight fist of ownership.\\n\\nNotice how the mind feels when it believes it must protect something. Notice how the jaw locks and the shoulders rise. When we soften the grip, the same moment feels breathable. This talk is an invitation to practice that softening with whatever we think belongs to us: time, attention, or the simple patience to listen.\\n\\nYou can begin with tiny gestures. Offer the person ahead of you in line the steadiness of your breath. Offer a co-worker the benefit of the doubt. Offer your own body rest when it is asking. In this way dana is not a project but a posture.\\n\\nAs this posture stabilizes, joy appears naturally. Joy is the confidence that we have enough to share. Whether the gift is a smile or a meal, the giver and receiver stand in the same circle. May this practice widen that circle for you."
