  "transcript": "Good morning, everyone. When the service happened this morning and it was Hakuin Zenji's Memorial Day, I decided to shift gears a little bit since my talk was on song and the nature of religious praise, in a sense, to begin with Hakuin's Song of Zazen.\n\nAnd Hakuin is a really wonderful character in many ways in the history of Zen. He was enlightened originally at the age of 24 at the sound of the temple gong, just like the gong we just heard. And it was a very deep enlightenment, but at the same time, immediately thereafter, an enormous arrogance formed. And he became very difficult to handle.\n\nAnd in reflection, years later, he said it was only the killing sword of his teacher who stayed with him and continued to work on the arrogance that evolved after his enlightenment that actually opened his heart to the way.\n\nSo Hakuin Zenji's Song of Zazen:\n\n\"Sentient beings are, in essence, Buddhas. It's like ice and water. There's no ice without water. There are no Buddhas outside sentient beings. What a shame that sentient beings seek afar, not knowing what is at hand. It's like wailing from thirst in the midst of water or wandering lost among the poor, although born a rich man's child.\n\n\"The cause of rebirth in the six realms is the darkness of our delusion. Treading dark path after dark path, when can we escape birth and death? Zazen goes beyond all praise. Giving, keeping precepts and the other perfections, chanting Buddha's name, repentance, training, and many other kinds of wholesome deeds all find their source in Zazen.\n\n\"When you sit even once, the merit obliterates countless wrongdoings. How can there be evil realms? The pure land is not far. If by good fortune you have the occasion to hear this teaching, admire it, and rejoice in it, you will attain boundless happiness. How much more if you dedicate yourself and realize your own nature directly.\n\n\"This own nature is no nature. You are already apart from useless discussions. The gate opens where cause and effect are inseparable. The road of not two, not three, goes straight ahead. Make the form formless form, going and returning, not anywhere else. Make the thought thoughtless thought, singing and dancing the Dharma voice.\n\n\"How vast the sky of unobstructed concentration. How brilliant the full moon of four-fold wisdom. At this very moment, what can be sought? Nirvana is immediate. This place is the lotus land. This body is the Buddha body.\"\n\nThis teaching of Hakuin, in a sense, brings up the use of energy, sound, form, and structure. When sound gets organized, when energy gets moved.\n\nThis weekend we did a retreat on Tai Chi. And still, there's something beyond just moving energy or just organizing sound. Something that distinguishes just compulsive, dead-hearted gesture from the kind of singing and dancing Dharma voice that Hakuin talks about.\n\nThat distinguishes rote motion and prose from the real poetry and dance of the way that makes a gesture, a chant, capable of healing, capable of expressing and manifesting and resounding through all beings with wholeness. It's the nature of liturgy. It's the nature of the real work.\n\nBut it's imperative that we get clear on what's missing in just moving energy around. There's nothing that makes me personally more annoyed than feeling this zendo, this space that's so dedicated and has had so much energy given to waking it up to see it used for dead-heartedness.\n\nTo feel the service happen and look around and see that half the people in the room are somewhere else. That during Kinhin we're walking around as if we're zombies. That during Zazen we're nodding off. It's more than posture.\n\nWhat alchemy solves the structure of the real chemical nature? What transforms matter and activity into the sacred and tender Dharma that Hakkowen referred to?\n\nDogen Zenji taught, \"If we don't practice it, it doesn't manifest. If we don't experience it, it can't be realized.\" And Zen training ceaselessly begs the question, forces the issue by insisting on a certain structure.\n\nThis is the way to bow. This is the way to sit Zazen. It's physical. It's specific. It's now. And yet the prime directive of Zen is the most radical revolutionary deconstruction of all structure. It's the most dangerous kind of anarchy.\n\nIt says take apart all of the structure because when you look at it closely enough, you'll see that it's impermanent. That even the structure we call our self deconstructs.\n\nSo what's happening in insisting on a structure and insisting on a form? It's the paradox of training, it's the paradox of spiritual life, of path, of way, of intention, of vow. And to not take it up personally, whether you call it Zen or spiritual life or doing right, is to miss the chance to sing this life, to realize the gatha.\n\nGatha means song, and it's not necessarily a pretty song. It's often misconstrued. It used to be that Buddhism and Zen were thought of as misty mountaintops, polished wood, a kind of neatness visually, and there was a romance around that.\n\nRecently we sent out our dharma communications catalog, and we've gotten a number of letters back from people saying what an extraordinarily technologically beautiful cover. They don't order anything; there's no indication of them engaging the practice contained within, but it's very pretty.\n\nAnd it's our birthright to discover it, to realize it, to not waste this life. Dogen Zenji wrote an essay called Bendawa, in which he takes up this issue very directly.\n\nWhen the Buddha Tathagatas each having received the one-to-one transmission of the splendid dharma experience the supreme state of Bodhi, they possess a subtle method which is supreme and without intention. The reason only this method is transmitted from Buddha to Buddha without deviation is that the samadhi of receiving and using the self is its standard.\n\nFor enjoyment of this samadhi, the practice of zazen in the erect sitting posture has been established as the authentic gate. This dharma is abundantly present in each human being, but if we do not practice it, it doesn't manifest. And if we don't experience it, it can't be realized.\n\nThe only authentic gate, the only method, is to make a vow to end all desires. Dogen says, \"Make a gesture beyond the obvious.\" Have some patience. The Buddha Tathagata is one who has arrived in the state of reality.\n\nSo when those who have arrived in the state of reality each having received the one-to-one transmission of the splendid dharma experience the supreme state of Bodhi, they possess this subtle method, supreme and without intention.\n\nThe reason only this method is transmitted from Buddha to Buddha without deviation is that the samadhi of receiving and using the self is its standard. Samadhi can be understood as the state of natural balance experienced when making effort without intentional aim.\n\nI liked \"receiving and using the self\" as an even clearer expression of samadhi. Receiving for most people in practice, there comes a moment when you get that, when you notice profoundly for the first time the measure to which we're each supported, and it varies among lives.\n\nBut I distinctly remember, and continue to drop back in, I've been there; are you know some bare spots? The samadhi of receiving and using. There's a koan in which someone sent out to find something that's not medicine. The teacher says, \"Go out into the town and bring me back something that's not medicinal.\"\n\nThe student comes back having gone down that path and says, \"I can't find anything that's not medicine.\" And so the teacher says, \"Well, show me something that is medicine.\" And the student picks a leaf of grass and offers it to the teacher who then uses it to teach the assembly.\n\nThe heart can open in the most unlikely circumstances, but we have to be clear on used for what. The title of this essay, Bendawa, is making an effort in pursuit of the truth. Ben means \"to make an effort,\" do the truth, wa a story.\n\nSo Bendawa is a talk about pursuing the truth or a talk about the practice of zazen. What do we use our lives for? Not abstractly, what do we use the lousy relationship for? What do we use the health problem for? What do we use the job for?\n\nWhat do we use the problem for? What do we use the nightly news for? No, this is not the plan; this is not medicine. Everything received and used for enjoyment of this samadhi.\n\nThe practice of zazen in the erect sitting posture has been established as the authentic gate. And again, this is probably the most potentially annoying past sentence in the piece: \"It's the authentic gate.\" How can that be? How can we not reject this statement immediately?\n\nWhat does it mean? Posture is the way to happiness; true peace is found by crossing your legs. Anyone who can't cross their legs just can't get in the gate. Is that the truth? Are you satisfied with that?\n\nWhat's going on? What's the true authentic only gate that leads to this enjoyment of samadhi? Obviously, it's this place is the lotus land. Akowin said it's not about interpreting it or creating a derivative variation on it.\n\nIt's not about understanding it; he brings us right into the area of disease in practice, the ways in which we step away and we re-enter the dark paths. We become lax or we become rigid. When we become lax, we say every way is the way; everything I do is Zen; everything is true; everything is equal.\n\nIn one sense, this is a kind of laxity, and the rigidity are basic response. We have to be willing to envision beyond the obvious. When perhaps you're punching five inches in, you're not letting the limit limit your mind.\n\nThese ways of limiting are often genderized by being understood as male and female energy, and it's useful in a sense that yin and yang understanding as long as we don't lock into being all one or all the other or I'm this and you're that.\n\nBut you can see that laxity, that passivity, as the kind of downside of the receptivity energy. When we become lax, there's a quality of despair, a kind of hopelessness. The positive side of that receptivity is that there's a recognition of change.\n\nWhen you're receiving, you're open; things are changing; there's no barrier. And women are often every sensibility shifts how you feel yourself to be changes and that vulnerable. So throughout history, the response has often been to keep feminine energy out of the public sphere because it's complex of expression and allowing that to mature as it can and find expression is necessary if we're to take care of this earth and each other and ourselves.\n\nBe felt when we respond to the unpredictable, when we're thrust into the unknown, and the energy that comes up is fearful rather than striking out and to ask for anything because fear is motive. The male energy is the disease of control conditioning that's always motivating itself in that kind of vital to act regardless.\n\nIt's an incredible weight that we put on beings, and the energy quality that's often experienced around that is anger. I don't know, but here do it this way; it has the possibility of stability, strength, structure. Usually involves a kind of physical armoring where we tense, we create a kind of framework again, a false structure to mobilize through what's going on.\n\nBoth diseases are dealt with in practice holding fast that structure. This is it; zazen is the only way; it's this mountain, not that mountain; it's now; cut the crap. Of course, we all have an equal say, and since that's how music shapes itself, that ability to let go and hold fast to sustain when resting in silence and passivity is simply self-indulgence and a lack of courage and imagination and a willingness to take a risk.\n\nAnd when dashing around intending yesterday in the workshop, he said after that this is very open because she trusts me. The implication being what about when the trust is not there? The edge being what about when life pushes us, and we don't trust the motivation?\n\nHow do we act dirty out, but he, the singer, says my good old Zen buddies think I'm okay, but I can't get his method, his way of opening up the reality of they were structurally along with Bendawa.\n\nThere's a number of people who are questioning Dogen in the kind of motif of the essay and giving him examples of other practices that are very worthwhile, strong, vigorous. What's so excellent then about the practice which you now solely recommend to the exclusion of these other practices?\n\nDogen says we need only know whether the practice is genuine or artificial. Some have entered into the stream of the Buddha's truth at the invitation of grass, flowers, mountains, and rivers. Some have received and maintained the stamp of Buddha by grasping soil, stones, sands, and pebbles.\n\nFurthermore, the vast and great word is even more abundant than the myriad phenomena, and the turning of the great Dharma wheel is contained in every molecule. This being so, the words \"mind here and now is Buddha\" are only the moon in water, and the idea just to sit is to become Buddha is also a reflection in a mirror.\n\nWe shouldn't be caught by the skillfulness of the words. Now in recommending the practice in which Bodhi is directly experienced, Bodhi being truth, I hope to demonstrate the subtle truth that the Buddhist ancestors have transmitted one to one and thus to make you into people of the real state of truth.\n\nTruth, we need only know whether the practice is genuine or artificial. Who needs to know that becomes the question? Is it real or is it Memorex? The television asks, \"Are you copying?\" What is it when we bow? What is it when we put on 13th-century Chinese robes, get a Zen haircut, wear a Zen bib, walk in straight lines, put a little carved doll in front of the room, use pieces of cloth, wood, ceramic as religious items?\n\nIs it because someone long ago said things that last tend to have been tested and challenged if they're useful? It's been found out, but fascism has lasted. Lasting isn't the whole litmus test.\n\nMind here and now is Buddha; the words are only moon in water. It's an image of it; it's not the thing itself. Just to sit is to become Buddha is also a reflection, and it's easy. You can't be caught by the skillfulness of words.\n\nNow in recommending the practice in which truth is directly experienced, that's the practice in which truth is exactly it's directly experienced. I hope to demonstrate the subtle truth that the Buddhist answer he's demonstrating the subtle truth by recommending zazen for transmission of the Buddha Dharma.\n\nWe must always take as a teacher a person who's experienced the Buddhist state. It's never enough to take as our guiding teacher a scholar who counts words; it would be like the blind leading the blind.\n\nIn this, the lineage of the authentic transmission of the Buddhist ancestors, we revere wise masters who have attained the truth and experienced the state, and we cause them to dwell in a level on which we should realize then Dawa continues that living and dying is just nirvana.\n\nBuddhists have never discussed nirvana outside of living and dying. Moreover, even if we wrongly imagine the understanding that mind becomes eternal by getting free of the body to be the same as the Buddha wisdom, which is free of life and death, the mind that is conscious of this understanding still appears and disappears momentarily.\n\nSo it's not eternal at all; then isn't this understanding unreliable? We should taste and reflect nirvana means outside the lineage of the dharma, which we the lineage of the dharma, which asserts that the Buddha Dharma that in the Buddha Dharma the essential state of mind universally includes all forms describes the whole great world of dharma inclusively without dividing essence and form and without discussing all dharmas.\n\nMyriad phenomena and accumulated things are totally just the one mind without exclusion or disunion. The practice is not confined to sitting itself; it strikes we are pain, and what cures pain? We are the sweet vowing to save all in what is recommended to others.\n\nVow it that the way to have to see you here."
