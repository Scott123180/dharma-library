  "transcript": "Transcription by CastingWords\nKoans of the Way of Reality, Case 108, The Great Pearls, Dana, Prologue.\nGiving generously means non-greed, not withholding.\nOne phrase, one verse, the ten thousand things, the hundred grasses.\nOne dharma, one realization, all Buddhas, all ancestors.\nSince the beginningless beginning, there has never been a single thing to withhold.\nWhen the Way is relinquished to the Way, the Way is realized.\nWhen the Way is realized, the Way is manifested through itself.\nWhen the Self gives the Self simply for the sake of giving,\nthe whole universe gives of itself for the sake of giving.\nThe cause and effect of this purposeless giving prevails throughout the heavens and encompasses the earth.\nHow can this truth be realized?\nListen to this old teaching, the main case.\nA monk asked the Great Pearl,\nBy what means can the gateway of our school be entered?\nBy means of Dhanaparamita, the Great Pearl said.\nThe monk said, according to the Buddha,\nThe Bodhisattva path comprises six paramitas.\nWhy then have you mentioned only one?\nThe Great Pearl said,\nDeluded people fail to understand that the other five all proceed from Dhanaparamita,\nand that by its practice all the others are fulfilled.\nThe monk said, why is it called Dhanaparamita?\nThe teacher said, Dhanaparamita means relinquishment.\nIt means total relinquishment of ideas as to the dual nature of good and bad,\nbeing and non-being, love and aversion, void and non-void,\nconcentration and distraction, pure and impure.\nBy giving all of them up, we attain to a state in which all opposites are seen as empty.\nThe capping verse.\nYou may understand it, but in vain.\nYou may believe it, but it's to no avail.\nYou may describe it, but it still remains a description.\nUltimately, how is it?\nThe river doesn't understand, yet it knows how to give itself to the great ocean.\nThe mountain has no words, yet it gives birth to the ten thousand things.\nIt is here that the sweet innocence of Dana is revealed.\nAs most of you, as I look around the room,\nI realize that most of you have been here for the weekend,\nso you were part of the whole Dana thing yesterday.\nBut there are also some that weren't here,\nso some of what I did as opening remarks to the Dana Paramita,\nor the Perfection of Giving weekend,\nand I'd like to repeat so that it's clear to everyone.\nDana, we translate, for those of you that are new to the term, as giving.\nAlthough giving doesn't quite reach it.\nIt's more than just something going from A to B.\nIt's the same as in the transmission of the Dharma.\nWe call it Dana Paramita, and Paramita means the practice of perfection,\nor crossing over to the other shore.\nAnd these Paramitas are part of Mahayana Buddhism.\nAnd in Zen, we understand the crossing over to the other shore\nas either the other shore and this shore are the same,\nor rather the other shore arrives.\nSo, Dana Paramita is understood loosely as the Perfection of Giving.\nAnd as all of you must have realized yesterday\nin the process of doing that weekend,\nthat the teachers of this weekend\nwere really the people that arrived on the buses.\nIt would be, you'd have to be totally blind\nand without any sensibility at all\nnot to have received an incredible amount of teaching\nfrom our guests the weekend.\nAnd that's at the heart of what Dana is about,\nthere can be no Dana unless there is both\ngiving and receiving occurring simultaneously.\nThat's the heart of Dana.\nIt goes both ways.\nIt must go both ways.\nThere can be no Dana unless the giver and the receiver are unified\nor become one reality in the process.\nSo, therefore, Dana is not charity.\nIt's not generosity.\nIt's not almsgiving or donations.\nor beneficence or benevolence or benefaction\nor contribution, gift, philanthropy, offering.\nDana is the practice of total relinquishment.\nAnd that's what the great pearl was talking about.\nTotal relinquishment, letting go,\nnot holding on to anything.\nAll the dualities must dissolve.\nAnd needless to say,\nwhen all the dualities dissolve,\neach of those paramitas,\neach of the six paramitas are there.\nDana, or giving, or the perfection of giving,\nis found throughout the Mahayana literature.\nIt appears in the precepts.\nFor example,\nbe generous, do not be withholding.\nThat's Dana.\nIt appears in the eight awarenesses of an enlightened person,\nthe 52 aspects of a bodhisattva.\nIt appears in the paramitas.\nIt appears as part of the morality,\nthe three basic teachings of the Buddha,\none of which was morality.\nSo, it's obviously considered by Buddhists\nto be one of the most important virtues.\nIt is the characteristic of a bodhisattva.\nIt's the life of a bodhisattva.\nAnd in the prologue, it says,\ngiving generously means non-greed.\nAnd if you really look at greed,\nyou realize that greed is exactly the opposite.\nGreed is about holding on.\nAnd dhana is about letting go,\nnot withholding, not holding back.\nAnd then the prologue says,\none phrase, one verse,\nten thousand things,\nthe hundred grasses,\none dharma, one realization,\nall Buddhas, all ancestors,\nsince the beginning.\nThere has never been\na single thing to withhold.\nSo, that's the ultimate truth\nthat underlies the whole thing.\nWe may proceed through the world\nwith an illusion of separateness,\nwith the illusion that the self\nand other are separate things.\nBut the fact is,\nthere is no separation to begin with.\nThat's why we call dharma,\nthe ten thousand things,\npurity itself.\nThere's nothing extraneous.\nThere's no outside.\nIt's all unified,\nwhether we've realized it or not.\nIf we haven't realized it,\nand we proceed on the assumption\nthat there's a self and other separation,\nthen we run into all kinds of difficulties.\nAnd that's what the pain and suffering\nof this life is about.\nThat's what we call samsara.\nSo, if you haven't realized it,\nalthough it's true,\nyou're not going in accord\nwith that realization.\nWhen you realize it,\nor when you practice\nin accord with the truth\nof that unity,\nthen it's a whole different way\nof living your life.\nthere has never been a single thing\nto withhold.\nBecause each one of us,\nthis very body and mind,\nyour very body and mind,\nis the body and mind\nof the universe.\nWhere would you hold it?\nAnd who would you give it to?\nAnd then the prologue says,\nwhen the way is relinquished\nto the way,\nwhen you give the way\nto the way,\nthe Tao,\nto the Tao,\nthe way is realized.\nWhen the way is realized,\nthe way is manifested\nthrough itself.\nSo, the way begins\nto manifest itself\nthrough itself\nwhen you've realized the way.\nWhat does it mean\nto have realized the way?\nIt means to have unified\nwith the way.\nWhen you are the way itself,\nthe way manifests\nthrough itself,\nwhich is none other\nthan manifesting\nthrough you.\nThat's what the next line means.\nWhen the self gives the self\nsimply for the sake of giving,\nthe whole universe\ngives of itself\nfor the sake of giving.\nAgain, that's about unification,\nno separation.\nThere's no reason for it.\nThere's no merit\nattached to it.\nIt's simply the way\nthe universe is.\nAnd so,\nthe giving\nis simply for the sake\nof giving,\nfor no other reason.\nLike,\nyou can wash the dishes\nin order to have\nclean dishes.\nThat makes it functional.\nThere's a purpose.\nThere's a process\nand there's a result.\nOr,\nyou can wash the dishes\nto wash the dishes.\nJust for the simple sake\nof washing the dishes.\nSo,\nthe cause and effect\nof this purposeless\ngiving\nprevails\nthroughout the heaven\nencompasses the earth.\nThat is,\nit is\nthe nature\nof things.\nWhether we've realized\nit for ourselves\nor not,\nit's the nature\nof things.\nSo,\nthis monk,\nin the main case,\ncomes up to\nthe great pearl.\nAnd the great pearl\nis the successor\nof\nMatsu,\nthe great\nmaster Basa\nwho had\n84\nenlightened\ndisciples\nthat he\ntransmitted to.\nHui Hai\nis one of those\ndisciples.\nHis name\nin\nin\nJapanese\nis\nDaishu.\nDaishu means\ngreat pearl.\nIkai.\nHe got\nthe name\ngreat pearl\nbecause he\nfirst began\nstudying with,\nhe was first\nordained\nby another teacher\nand then\nwent to study\nwith Matsu\nand studied\nwith him\nfor a while\nand then\nhis first teacher\nbecame very ill\nand so he\nleft Matsu\nand went back\nto take care\nof his old teacher\nand while he\nwas back\nthere he\nwrote\na discourse\nand\nI'm trying\nto remember\nwhat that\ndiscourse\nwas.\nI guess\nit was a\ndiscourse\non sudden\nelimination\nand\na monk\nwho was\nthere\ntook that\ntreatise\nto\nMatsu\nand when\nMatsu\nread it\nhe said\nthere is\na great\npearl\non that\nmountain\nand\nalthough\nhe had\nthe name\nIkai\nit was\nthe name\nDaishu\nor great\npearl\nthat kind\nof stuck\nwith him\nso this\nmonk\nasked\nthe great\npearl\nby what\nmeans\ncan the\ngateway\nof our\nschool\nbe entered\nand\nhe answered\nby means\nof\nDhanaparamita\nand this\nkoan\nis not\na koan\nin the\nusual sense\nof the word\nit tends\nto be\nvery\nexplanatory\nand I\nthink the\nreason is\nis that\nit arose\nfrom\na\nmundo\nrather\nthan\na\ndharma\ncombat\nshosan\ndharma\ncombats\ntend to\nbe\nmore\ndirect\npointing\nmore\nhead\nsqueezing\nmondos\ntend to\nbe\nintellectual\nand\nexplanatory\nand this\nis kind\nof\nintellectual\nand\nexplanatory\nbut it\nhas some\nvalue\nbecause of\nhis particular\nway of\nexpressing it\nthat I\nthought was\nimportant for\nus to\nuse and\nto treat\nit as a\nkoan\nso he\nsays by\nmeans of\nDhanaparamita\nso the\nmonk said\naccording to\nthe Buddha\nthe bodhisattva\npath comprises\nsix paramitas\nwhy then\nhave you\nmentioned\nonly one\nand the\ngreat pearl\nsaid deluded\npeople fail\nto understand\nthat the\nother five\nall proceed\nfrom\nDhanaparamita\nand it's\nby the\npractice\nby its\npractice\nthe practice\nof giving\nthat all\nthe others\nare fulfilled\nand in a\nsense you\ncan say\nthat for\nany of\nthe paramitas\nyou can say\nthat from\nany of\nthe\nprecepts\nyou can say\nthat for\nthe eight\ngates\nof Zen\nthat in\neach one\nof them\nthe other\nare contained\nand if you\nrealize any\none of them\nfully\nyou've realized\nthat in fact\nyou can say\nthat of any\nkoan\nthat if you\nexhaust the\nkoan\ncompletely\nthoroughly\nall of the\nramifications\nand permutations\nand combination\nof a single\nkoan\nyou've realized\nall of the\nkoans\nand then\nthe monk\nsays why\nis it\ncalled\ndana\nparamita\nand he\nanswers\ndana\nmeans\nrelinquishment\nrelinquishment\nof what\nrelinquishment\nof
